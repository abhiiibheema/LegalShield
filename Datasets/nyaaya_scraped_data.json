It is to make sure that the person does not run away. The amount might be less or more, depending upon the nature of the crime. In case you don’t have money, your property can be attached to get bail. This deposit of money or attachment of property is mandatory for bail. The Court may ask the person to not leave the territory of the country and report to the court whenever he is required to do so under the Bond.\n\n\n\n- Personal Bond\n\nIn certain cases, while granting a person bail, the Court may not ask them to submit a bail bond, but instead release them on their own promise, or what is commonly known as a personal bond. Bail can be granted on a personal bond either with or without sureties. Courts have discretion in the matter so they may release the accused by taking only a personal bond without insisting for a surety.\n\n\n\n- Surety\n\nWhen you approach the court for bail, sometimes the court wants sufficient guarantees to ensure you won’t run away. The court may ask you to get some people to take this responsibility. The same person does not have to always remain a surety. A person acting as a surety can apply to be ‘discharged’ from their position of a surety.  In such a circumstance, you will need to replace the surety. You will need to get another person to the Court to sign as your new surety. If you can’t replace the surety, you will be taken into custody.",

Actions such as following a person on the streets or in any public space, peeping into their bedroom, making sexual gestures at them while they are at work or in the classroom, singing lewd songs – all of this issexual harassment.Under the law, only a man can be punished for the crime.(( Section 354A and 354, Indian Penal Code, 1860.))\n\nThere are many ways to reach out to an authority that will help, and anyone can file a complaint on a survivor’s behalf. A survivor can file acomplaintof sexual harassment, irrespective of the place where it has happened. AnFIRcan be filed atany police station. The fact that the crime may not have been committed in that police station’sjurisdictionhas no consequence to the filing of the complaint. It is mandatory for the police to record the information provided, and then transfer it to the police station in whose area/jurisdictionthe offence took place. For instance, if a crime was committed in North Delhi, the information can even be registered with a police station in South Delhi.\n\nThe law deals with four categories of sexual harassment(( Section 354A, Indian Penal Code, 1860.)):\n\n- Physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures (Inappropriate sexual touch)\n- A demand or request forsexual favours\n- Making sexualremarks and threats\n- Showing pornography\n\nThe punishment for inappropriately touching, demanding or requesting sexual favours and making sexual coloured remarks is jail time up to three years with a fine. For showing pornography, the jail time is up to one year along with a fine.1\n\nA survivor can go to the police and file anFIRafter which the police will investigate and file charges before the court. The court will then decide whether the person is guilty or not. If the person is found to be guilty, they will be fined and punished with jail time depending on the kind of crime committed.\n\nTo explore more on complaining against the perpetrator, you can read our explainer on ‘How do you complain against sexual crimes’.\n\nIf a child (below the age of 18) has been sexually harassed by anyone, including someone they know, relatives, friends, etc., anyone including the parents or teachers can report the crime on behalf of the child. It is illegal to not report the crime and a person can face criminal consequences for knowing about the crime and not reporting it.(( Juvenile Justice Act (Care and Protection of Children), 2015; The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012.))

This FIR can either be filed by the survivor, their family members, any person who has witnessed the crime, or any person who comes to know of the crime.\n\nSince acid attack and throwing/ attempting to throw acid are cognizable offences under S. 326A and 326B respectively of the IPC, the police may arrest the accused without a warrant, where the police are of the opinion that the person is dangerous to be allowed to remain free. The person filing an FIR also has the right to get a free copy of the FIR.\n\nStep 2: Police Investigation Starts\n\nAfter the filing of the FIR, the police will investigate the complaint and submit a final report based on the investigation and witness statements. This investigation should be completed within a time span of 60 to 90 days, when the accused is in custody.(( Section 167, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.))\n\nStep 3: Filing Charge Sheet and Trial Begins\n\nUpon investigation, if the police are of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence of the crime being committed by the accused, they can file a charge sheet with a competent criminal court, requesting it to take notice of the case. This commences the trial process. If there is inadequate evidence, a closure report can be filed with the Magistrate to close the case. However, this may be challenged.

            "content": "[Trigger Warning:The following content contains information on physical violence which some readers may find disturbing.]\n\nSurvivors of acid attacks have the following rights under the law:\n\n\n\nRight to Seek Medical Treatment\n\nA survivor of an acid attack has the right to seekmedical treatmentin both government and private hospitals. The Supreme Court issued guidelines for acid attack crimes where they said that:\n\n- No hospital or clinic can refuse to treat acid attack survivors citing the lack of specialized facilities.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n- Government and private hospitals have to provide survivors with first-aid and medical treatment free of cost.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nThe court has placed the responsibility for the treatment and rehabilitation of survivors on the state government.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [29].)) Additionally, it has expected states and union territories to take action against hospitals that refuse to treat acid attack survivors.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nRight to File a Complaint\n\nAcid attack survivors also have the right tofile a complaintagainst the perpetrator. The complaint can also be filed by the survivor’s relative, friend or acquaintance, any person who has witnessed the crime, or any person who comes to know of the crime. To see a list of other persons who can file the complaint, seehere.\n\nRight to Compensation\n\nAcid attack survivors have the right to seekcompensationfrom the state government. The Victims Compensation Scheme(( Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes 2018, National Legal Services Authority, accessed athttps://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/Final%20VC%20Sheme_0.pdf.)) that was drafted by the National Legal Services Authority, was approved by the Supreme Court in 2018. It provides for mandatory compensation for survivors of acid attacks as well as sexual crimes including sexual assault, murder, kidnapping etc. Apart from compensation under this scheme, the survivor receives the fine amount that the perpetrator pays for committing the crime which is charged by the Court.(( Section 357B, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.))\n\nVarious state governments have formed Victim Compensation Schemes for acid attack survivors. Keeping in mind that there is a lack of uniformity in the state schemes, and the amount of compensation specified in most of these schemes is too low, the Supreme Court stated that:\n\n- The minimum amount of Rupees 3 lakh must be provided by the state government to every survivor.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [13], [14].)) This is the minimum amount, and the state government can provide a higher amount, where necessary.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- Any compensation amount must factor in not only the survivor’s physical injuries but also their inability to lead a full life.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- The Chief Secretary/ Administrator of the state/UT concerned must ensure that this amount is paid.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [14].))\n\nTo learn more on information on schemes in different states for survivors of violence, contact details of one-stop centres, protection officers and helpline numbers, check out the Nyaaya Map on Key Information for Survivors of Violence.\n\nGiven below are the list of State Victim CompensationSchemesin India:",

Noise at such levels may beinjuriousto human beings, living creatures, plants, property and the environment2\n\nThe law knownas the Noise Pollution (Regulation And Control) Rules, 2000regulates and controls noise in India.\n\nEveryone has the right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950 to live in peace, comfort and quiet within their house and has a right to prevent the noise from reaching them3. No one can claim a right to create noise even in their own premises which would travel beyond their precincts and cause nuisance to neighbours or others. That’s why any noise which affects the ordinary comforts of life of a person is also considered to be a nuisance4.\n\nThe word noise is not explained in any law but noise is considered to be an environmental pollutant1in India. It is one of the main causes of environmental pollution.\n\nNoise derives its meaning from the Latin term ‘nausea’. Courts have defined noise as ‘unwanted sound, a potential hazard to health and communication dumped into the environment with regard to the adverse effect it may have on unwilling ears4. For example, a blaring horn causes unwanted noise but the sound which pleases the listeners is music and is not considered to be noise4.\n\nDecibel is the unit of measurement of noise. There are noise limits that you will have to follow depending on the area you live in. However, since measuring noise requires scientific instruments (such as a sound level meter), you may not always know if you are exceeding the noise limits for a particular area. In such cases, you should:\n\n- Make sure that regardless of what you do or which equipment you use, it does not turn out to benoisy and a disturbance for others.For example, if you are playing music during a party, try to keep the volume down at night time while people are sleeping.\n- Don’t wait for your neighbours or people around you to file a complaint to the police. If they mention that you are making noise that is disturbing them, try toreduce the noise.\n\nPlease note that it does not matter whether you made the noise unintentionally or intentionally; all that matters is whether you have created too much noise.\n\nIf any noise causes you annoyance, discomfort or any injury, then you can file acomplaintwith the police or your State’s Pollution Control Board. Otherwise, you can also complain if you know that the noise5. level is disturbing you or it happensat night between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am.",

            "content": "[Trigger Warning:The following content contains information on physical violence which some readers may find disturbing.]\n\nSurvivors of acid attacks have the following rights under the law:\n\n\n\nRight to Seek Medical Treatment\n\nA survivor of an acid attack has the right to seekmedical treatmentin both government and private hospitals. The Supreme Court issued guidelines for acid attack crimes where they said that:\n\n- No hospital or clinic can refuse to treat acid attack survivors citing the lack of specialized facilities.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n- Government and private hospitals have to provide survivors with first-aid and medical treatment free of cost.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nThe court has placed the responsibility for the treatment and rehabilitation of survivors on the state government.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [29].)) Additionally, it has expected states and union territories to take action against hospitals that refuse to treat acid attack survivors.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nRight to File a Complaint\n\nAcid attack survivors also have the right tofile a complaintagainst the perpetrator. The complaint can also be filed by the survivor’s relative, friend or acquaintance, any person who has witnessed the crime, or any person who comes to know of the crime. To see a list of other persons who can file the complaint, seehere.\n\nRight to Compensation\n\nAcid attack survivors have the right to seekcompensationfrom the state government. The Victims Compensation Scheme(( Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes 2018, National Legal Services Authority, accessed athttps://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/Final%20VC%20Sheme_0.pdf.)) that was drafted by the National Legal Services Authority, was approved by the Supreme Court in 2018. It provides for mandatory compensation for survivors of acid attacks as well as sexual crimes including sexual assault, murder, kidnapping etc. Apart from compensation under this scheme, the survivor receives the fine amount that the perpetrator pays for committing the crime which is charged by the Court.(( Section 357B, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.))\n\nVarious state governments have formed Victim Compensation Schemes for acid attack survivors. Keeping in mind that there is a lack of uniformity in the state schemes, and the amount of compensation specified in most of these schemes is too low, the Supreme Court stated that:\n\n- The minimum amount of Rupees 3 lakh must be provided by the state government to every survivor.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [13], [14].)) This is the minimum amount, and the state government can provide a higher amount, where necessary.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- Any compensation amount must factor in not only the survivor’s physical injuries but also their inability to lead a full life.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- The Chief Secretary/ Administrator of the state/UT concerned must ensure that this amount is paid.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [14].))\n\nTo learn more on information on schemes in different states for survivors of violence, contact details of one-stop centres, protection officers and helpline numbers, check out the Nyaaya Map on Key Information for Survivors of Violence.\n\nGiven below are the list of State Victim CompensationSchemesin India:",

Given below are some of the punishable crimes:\n\nNon-Physical Behaviour\n\n- Anynon-physical sexual behaviourthrough gestures, speech, and visuals. For example, gesturing to a child’s private parts or showing naked pictures(( Section 11, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.))\n- Any act related tochild pornography, including its creation, distribution, transmission, publication, etc.(( Section 13, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.))\n- Administering any drug, hormone or any chemical substance to a child so that the child attains early sexual maturity.(( Section 9(v), The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012; Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act, 2019.))\n\nPhysical Behaviour\n\n- Touching a child in a sexually inappropriate way. For example, touching the private parts of a child.(( Section 7, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012; Section 9, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.))\n- Sexually abusing a child through penetration –either with a penis or any other object.(( Section 3, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012; Section 5, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.))\n\nAttempt of sexual abuse\n\nIf a person tries to commit(( Section 18, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.)) any sexual crime against a child, this is also a crime. It does not matter if the offender fails to actually commit  the crime , the attempt itself will hold them liable.\n\nFurther, the law also makes a distinction based on the person committing the offence. For example, if any sexual abuse done by a person in aposition of trust or authorityto the child like a teacher or police officer, the punishment is higher.(( Section 5, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012; Section 9, The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.)) The law defines these kinds of abuse as “aggravated” to highlight the fiduciary relationship between the harasser and the child. Read more in our explainerhere.",

Some of the acts considered as ragging are:(( Section 3, theUGC Regulations On Curbing The Menace Of Ragging In Higher Educational Institutions, 2009.))\n\nPsychological Harm\n\nCausing psychological harm to a student is considered to be ragging under the law. This may include:\n\n- Any written, verbal or behavioural actions by a student including teasing a student, speaking rudely, etc. For example, calling a student derogatory names.\n- Rowdy or undisciplined behaviour which may annoy the student, cause hardship or psychological harm to any student. For example, stealing and throwing away the notebooks that belong to a student or threatening a student constantly.\n- Asking a student to do an act which he would not ordinarily do. Such incidents may cause a sense of shame, torment or embarrassment to the student thereby affecting his psychological wellbeing. For example, making a student dance in front of the class.\n- Any act that affects the mental health and self-confidence of any student. For example, making a student dance in front of the class and ridiculing him for it.\n- An act or abuse, whether written, verbal or online (emails, posts, etc.), which would result in making a student uncomfortable. For example, spreading rumours on online platforms about a student or ragging for the sake of deriving pleasure out of it.\n\nDisturbing Academic Activity\n\nRagging can take the form of disturbing a student’s academics. If any student prevents, disrupts or disturbs the regular academic activity of  another student, it is ragging. For example, a senior student harassing a junior student into not attending classes.\n\nUsing or Exploiting a Student\n\nRagging can take the form of exploitation of another student. This includes:\n\n- Exploiting the services of any student for completing the academic tasks assigned to an individual/group. For example, making a student do some other student’s homework assignments.\n- Financial extortion or forceful expenditure put on any student.  For example, making a student pay for another student’s expenses.\n\nPhysical Abuse\n\nRagging can take the form of physical abuse and violence. Ragging includes:\n\n- Rowdy behaviour or indiscipline which is likely to cause physical harm  to any student, or any act which makes one fearful/apprehensive of physical harm. For example, threatening to beat up a student.\n- Asking a student to do an act which he would not ordinarily do, and which causes him a sense of shame, torment or embarrassment so as to adversely affect his physical well-being. For example, beating up a student because he did not comply with the orders of a senior to perform a task.\n- Sexual abuse, including assaults, stripping, forcing obscene and lewd acts or gestures, etc. For example, asking a female student to strip.\n- Any act which causes bodily harm or any other danger to a student. For example, mixing laxatives in a student’s food.\n\nDiscriminating against Another Student\n\nRagging can take the form of discrimination and prejudice against another student. Any abuse based on the colour of your skin, race, religion, caste, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, nationality, regional origins, linguistic identity, place of birth, place of residence or economic background, is considered as ragging. For example, if a student is constantly teased and called names based on her regional origins, or is ridiculed because she belongs to a lower socioeconomic status than other students, it can be considered as ragging.\n\nThe intent behind ragging does not matter. For example, to derive pleasure, for fun, to show off authority or superiority – the very act of ragging is a crime under Indian law.\n\nIf you are being ragged, you cancomplainto college authorities or the police.",

The rights that citizens of India have differ from non-citizens. For example, only citizens of India can contest in elections.1\n\nProof of Citizenship\n\nIn India, the government has not mandated that citizens should hold any particular document to be regarded as Indian citizens, except in Assam. Indian citizens may choose which proof(s) of identification they want to acquire, based on the services that card/document provides. For instance, one must have aPAN Cardto be able to file income tax returns or aVoter ID Cardto vote in elections, but the government does not mandatorily require you to possess any of these proofs of identification.\n\nHowever, please note that noproof of identification, such asAadhar,Passport, is a conclusive proof of citizenship in India.\n\nAcquiring Indian Citizenship\n\nUnder the law, you are considered an Indian citizen if you are born in India and fall in one of the 3 categories below:2\n\n- If you were born between 26th January 1950 to 1st July 1987: You are a citizen irrespective of the nationality of your parents.\n- If you were born between 1st July 1987 to 3rd December 2004:  One of your parents should have been an Indian citizen when you are born\n- If you were born on or after 3rd December 2004: Both your parents must be  Indian citizens; or if only one of your parents is a citizen, then the other is not an illegal immigrant\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was notified in March 2024. It offers a fast track to citizenship for persecuted minorities (Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Jain, and Christian) from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.  They can apply for citizenship through a simplified process if they can show evidence of religious persecution in their home country.The residency requirement for these minorities seeking citizenship has been reduced to 6 years, as opposed to the standard 11 years required for naturalization under other circumstances.\n\nThere are three other procedures that can be followed to become an Indian citizen i.e. bydescent,naturalizationand registration.3Through these, you can also acquire Indian citizenship if you were born outside India in certain cases. Indian residents and others, who are not citizens by birth, canapplyfor Indian citizenship.\n\nTermination of Indian Citizenship\n\nYour status as an Indian citizen can be terminated if:\n\n- You give up your Indian citizenship.4\n- You voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country.5\n\nFurthermore,  if you are not born as an Indian citizen and have acquired citizenship by naturalisation or registration under certain circumstances, then the Government  may deprive you of your status as an Indian citizen:\n\n- If you show yourself to bedisloyaltowards the Constitution of India,6\n- If your citizenship  was obtainedfraudulently, by false representation or by not revealing crucial facts,7etc.\n- If, during any war India is engaged in, you have unlawfully traded or communicated with an enemy, or knowingly associated with any business assisting the enemy,8\n- If you weresentenced to jail in any countryfor at least 2 years, within 5 years of being registered/naturalized as an Indian citizen,9\n- If you have beenresiding out of India for more than 7 years continuously, without being enrolled in any educational institute in that country, or in the service of Government of India, or an international organization of which India is a member. Your citizenship may also be deprived if, during this time,  you have not demonstrated your intention to be an Indian citizen through the prescribed requirements.10\n\nRead this governmentresourceto know more.",

Parents of children belonging to disadvantaged groups should get representation in theSchool Management Committeesin proportion to the number of such students enrolled.1Specified category schools and unaided private schools are mandated to admit in first class (Class 1), children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groups to a minimum of 25% of the class size.2\n\nWhile children belonging to disadvantaged groups earlier did not extend to children with HIV, the Supreme Court of India ordered that the State Governments should consider adding children living with or affected by HIV to disadvantaged groups by way of notification givenhere.3Consequently, children with HIV are counted under disadvantaged groups for the Right to Education in Union Territories of Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.4Karnataka also includes children with HIV under disadvantaged groups. More states may include children with HIV or affected by HIV in the disadvantaged groups for the purpose of RTE.5\n\nChildren belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are also included under the category of disadvantaged groups in the RTE law. Certain states in India give priority to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in case of 25% admissions to disadvantaged categories in specific categories and unaided private schools. For example, the state of Haryana6provides for a reservation of 5% seats out of the 25% admissions for Scheduled Castes. Similarly, the state of Karnataka has 7.5% and 1.5% seats EWS seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively.7\n\nAll children, who are citizens of India have a right to education, including children with disabilities. The Constitution of India provides that nobody can be denied admission into any educational institution based on their religion, race, caste or language8Moreover, the State is directed to provide free and compulsory education for all until the age of 14 years and no child can be denied admission to any educational institution maintained by state funds on grounds such as religion, race, caste or language.9\n\nA child with a disability has special rights for getting an education. Some of these are:\n\nAlso, the government has to take special steps to help children with disabilities get an education including:\n\n- Provision of safe transport facilities to enable them to attend school and complete elementary education.11\n- Materials for special learning and educational support.12\n- Provision of scholarships, part-time classes, informal education and make it easier for such children to give exams etc. A child with 80% disability or two or more disabilities can choose to be educated at home.13",

The causes of air pollution include:2\n\n- Solid Air Pollutant. For example, burning of solid fuels such as firewood, crop residue, cow dung cakes, coal, lignite and charcoal.3\n- Liquid Air Pollutant. For example, use of gasoline, kerosene and diesel in households.\n- Gaseous Air Pollutant. For example, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen.\n- Noise Pollutant. For example, harsh sounds from traffic, engines, generators and fireworks.\n\nThe National Ambient Air QualityStandards, set by the Central Pollution Control Board, lay down the permissible limits of twelve pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, trioxygen, lead, carbon monoxide, ammonia, benzene, arsenic, nickel and particulate matter.

            "content": "There are five kinds of constitutional remedies available.1These are:\n\nThe term ‘habeas corpus’ literally means ‘produce the body’. In this context, it refers to a direction from a court to bring a person before the court. If a person is illegally restrained and deprived of their liberty, a writ petition forhabeas corpuscan be filed to ask the court to secure their release. The court can issue the writ ofhabeas corpusto any public authority having a person unlawfully in their custody and order the authority to bring the person before the court. In this manner, the court inquires into the circumstances of any person’s detention and can give the necessary judgement against unlawful restraint.((Kanu Sanyal v. District Magistrate, Darjeeling, 1973 AIR 2684.))The court can also issue the writ ofhabeas corpusin cases of illegal inhuman treatment of prisoners.((Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, 1980 AIR 1579.))The application forhabeas corpuscan be filed by the imprisoned/detained person or by anyone else who is not an absolute stranger to them.\n\nFor example, if a prisoner is being ill-treated in prison, they can file ahabeas corpuspetition against such treatment.\n\n\n\n2. Mandamus\n\nThe court issues a writ ofmandamusto order an authority to perform their public duty as required by law.((State of Mysore & Anr. v. K.N. Chandrasekhara & Anr., 1965 AIR (SC) 532.))To get this remedy, it is necessary to show that the public authority has a mandatory legal duty and the petitioner has a legal right to enforce its performance.((Rai Shivendra Bahadur v. Governing Body of Nalanda College, AIR 1962 SC 1210.))However, people cannot file for a writ ofmandamusagainst the President of India or the Governor of a State((Article 361, Constitution of India, 1950.)), or officers in legislatures.2Before applying formandamus, the petitioner should have first approached the authority with a distinct demand which the authority refuses to enforce.((Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. v. Union of India, 1975 AIR 460.))\n\nFor example, if, despite repeated complaints, a Municipal Corporation refuses to perform its legal duty of supplying water to an area, a person living in that area can file amandamuspetition to make the Corporation perform its duty.\n\n\n\n3. Certiorari\n\nThe writ ofcertiorariis applicable when someone with legal authority and a judicial duty to make decisions affecting the rights of people, exceeds their legal authority. The court can issue this remedy to cancel the order of any lower judicial authority which has exceeded its legal powers and made a decision despite not having the power to do so.((Province of Bombay v. Kusaldas S. Advani & Ors., 1950 AIR 222.))\n\nFor example, if an Industrial Tribunal delivers a judgement on a non-industrial dispute without having the authority to do so, an aggrieved person can approach the concerned High Court/Supreme Court with a petition forcertiorarito cancel the Tribunal’s decision.\n\n\n\n4. Prohibition\n\nThe court can issue the writ ofprohibitionto order any lower court/tribunal to stop legal proceedings on a certain matter.((East India Commercial Company Ltd. v. The Collector of Customs, 1962 AIR 1893.))This remedy is used to restrain a lower judicial authority from exceeding its legal authority and to confine lower courts/tribunals within their judicial boundaries.Prohibitioncan also be used in case a lower judicial authority has not obeyed the rules of natural justice i.e. if the authority shows bias or does not hear out both parties.((S. Govinda Menon v. Union of India, 1967 AIR 1274.))\n\nFor example, if an Industrial Tribunal takes up a non-industrial dispute without having the authority to judge the dispute, an aggrieved person can approach the concerned High Court/Supreme Court with a petition forprohibitionto stop the ongoing legal proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\n\n\n5. Quo Warranto\n\nThe writ ofquo warrantois a remedy that allows the court to ask any person who holds a public office to prove their right to hold the office. In case they don’t have the right to hold the public position, they will be removed from that office by judicial order. This remedy controls the executive from making illegal appointments to a public office and protects citizens from people who illegally hold public office depriving citizens of their rights. To claimquo warranto, a petitioner has to show the court that the office is a public office and that the person holding it has no legal authority to hold the office. This will lead to an inquiry on whether their appointment has been made legally.(( TheUniversity of Mysore v. Govinda Rao, 1965 AIR 41.))\n\nFor example, if someone feels that the Speaker of a Legislative Assembly does not have the qualifications to hold this public office, they can approach the  Court to issue a writ ofquo warrantoto inquire about the appointment.\n\n",

You can file with the Tribunal in the area where:\n\n- You live currently, or\n- Have lived in the past, or\n- Where your children or relatives live.\n\nOnce you file an application with the Tribunal, you cannot file an application formaintenance under Section 125of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (which also gives you the same right).\n\nAfter you have filed an application (the format will vary from state to state), the court will first notify your children and tell them that you have filed such an application. Then, the court can decide to refer the case to a Conciliation Officer, who will try to get the parties to agree to a friendly settlement. If the court does not refer the case, it will listen to both the parties.\n\nThe court will conduct an inquiry to figure out how much maintenance you need to be paid. An inquiry is not a full-fledged legal proceeding. Even though the law does not allow for representation by lawyers in these courts, there are high court judgments which have held that this right of lawyers cannot be restricted. This court is slightly informal in nature but it has the powers of a civil court and can order attendance of witnesses, take evidence on oath, etc.\n\nIf the court finds that your children or relatives are neglecting to take care of you, it can pass an order directing them to pay a monthly maintenance. The court can also order that interest (between 5% and 8%) be paid on the maintenance amount from the date of the application. If your children or parents are not paying the maintenance even after the court order, you can go to any similar court (maintenance tribunal) and ask for help in enforcing the order.",

            "content": "One of the most critical aspects to consider when buying a land or house, is knowing whether:\n\nThe price of the property is fair\n\nSince land and property fall under State subjects as per the Constitution of India, laws and transactional rules vary depending on the state where the property is located. Depending on where the property is located and the nature of construction (if applicable), different states have introduced a system of determining a minimum base price for the property, called ‘circle rate’, or ‘ready reckoner rate’. These circle rates are speculative and vary greatly even within the same city- from one area to another- and are frequently updated and notified. In addition to the location-based circle rates, the value of a property is also affected by the services it has access to, and the builder/ housing society. However, these circle rates only serve as guides, and the actual price may vary based on the market value of the property, called fair market value.\n\nThe ownership of the property is free of disputes\n\nThere are various ways in which you can find out if the ownership of the property you want to purchase is disputed. The simplest way is to check the title deeds of the property in question. You can also enquire with the local tehsildar’s office or that of the village officer where the property is located. Other documents such as e-record of rights, property tax receipts, and survey documents are also used to establish ownership.",

            "content": "[Trigger Warning: The following content contains information on domestic violence which some readers may find disturbing.]\n\nYou live in a shared household with your harasser if you:\n\nIn order to seek protection and relief, you must live, or have lived at some point of time, with your harasser in the household. However, it is not necessary that you are residing with your husband at the time of filing a complaint for domestic violence(( Sejal Dharmesh Ved v. The State of Maharashtra and Ors 2014 ALL MR (Cri) 636; Rupali Devi v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.  (2019) 5 SCC 384.)), or that you are residing with him when the violence took place.(( Lalita Toppo v. State of Jharkhand & Anr.  2018 (4) RCR (Criminal) 976.)) You just need to have shared a household with the harasserat some point of time.\n\nIn order to seek relief and protection from domestic violence, you need to have adomestic relationshipwith your abuser, in addition to having a shared household with them. For example, if you have lived with your mother-in-law in the same house, and you are being subjected to domestic violence, you can seek relief and protection, as it means that you had a domestic relationship with the harasser and lived with her in a shared household.\n\nHowever, if you have merely lived in a shared household, but did not share a domestic relationship with the harasser, you cannot file a complaint against domestic violence. For example, if you have a servant who resides in your house, and he beats you up, you cannot file a complaint under this law against him, as you do not have adomestic relationshipwith him.\n\nTo claim relief and protection, it does not matter if you have a legal share in the house. This household can be owned/leased by either you, the harasser , or the both of you, and also includes households that belong to the joint family of which the harasser is a part, even if you do not have a legal right in it.\n\nHowever, if the property is the exclusive, personal property of the parents-in-law, or any other relative of the harasser, you do not have a right to claim any share in that house, as that is not a shared household.(( S.R. Batra v. Taruna Batra (2007) 3 SCC 169.))  However, the Court will ultimately decide whether or not to allow you to reside in a particular house according to the facts of the case, so you may be allowed to reside in a house owned by your mother-in-law in some cases.  Seeherefor more details on residence orders.\n\nPlease note that it is not necessary that the violence has taken place only in the house where you reside; it can take placeanywhere.\n\nSome states provide handbooks for ASHA workers where you can find more information on forms on violence, where it can happen and how to file a complaint to seek protection against domestic violence. For example, seethis handbookpublished for ASHA in Chattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand.",

Simran’s father has given a new house as dowry to Raj’s uncle, Aman in connection with the marriage. In this case, Aman must give it to Simran otherwise he will be punished under the law.\n\n- If the property was received before the wedding, then Aman must give it to Simran within 3 months of the wedding (before 20th November)\n- If the property was received on the day of the wedding or after, then Aman must give it to Simran within 3 months from the date on which he received it.\n- If Simran was below 18 at the time of her wedding, then Aman must give the car to Simran within 3 months of her turning 18. Aman must keep it in trust for her till she turns 18.\n\nIf you die before taking possession of the dowry/property, then your heirs can claim it from your husband or in-laws.\n\nIf you die within 7 years of the marriage, then the property will be transferred to your children. It will be held in trust for them until they are 18. If you have no children, the property will go to your parents.",

            "content": "Land and housing are valuable assets, and as an owner, you can choose to seek a bank loan by using the property as a collateral. A ‘collateral’ is a valuable asset that a borrower offers as an assurance against which they can secure a loan. If you are unable to repay the money, you may lose ownership over the asset which you have offered as a collateral to the lender. For the lender, the collateral acts as a safety net.\n\nWhen seeking a bank loan (business, education etc), especially when it is for a higher amount, banks require individuals to offer some asset as collateral for security. For this purpose, you can offer either self-occupied residential or commercial property. You will be required to provide proof of ownership in the form of title deeds at the time of registering for a loan. The banks decide the credibility and the value of the land / house being offered as a collateral against the requested amount for the loan. Generally, the chances of approval are high when using a land or housing property as collateral.",

In some cases, the brokers can be very helpful while trying to negotiate the rent, so you can also request him to accompany you during the rent negotiations.\n\nWhile inspecting the house if you have come across any changes or additions to be made, you should tell your landlord before signing the contract. It is helpful to do it before as you will know whether the landlord is open to negotiations for the requirements you want and to assess whether you are getting your house for the best price.

Noise at such levels may beinjuriousto human beings, living creatures, plants, property and the environment2\n\nThe law knownas the Noise Pollution (Regulation And Control) Rules, 2000regulates and controls noise in India.\n\nEveryone has the right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950 to live in peace, comfort and quiet within their house and has a right to prevent the noise from reaching them3. No one can claim a right to create noise even in their own premises which would travel beyond their precincts and cause nuisance to neighbours or others. That’s why any noise which affects the ordinary comforts of life of a person is also considered to be a nuisance4.\n\nThe word noise is not explained in any law but noise is considered to be an environmental pollutant1in India. It is one of the main causes of environmental pollution.\n\nNoise derives its meaning from the Latin term ‘nausea’. Courts have defined noise as ‘unwanted sound, a potential hazard to health and communication dumped into the environment with regard to the adverse effect it may have on unwilling ears4. For example, a blaring horn causes unwanted noise but the sound which pleases the listeners is music and is not considered to be noise4.\n\nDecibel is the unit of measurement of noise. There are noise limits that you will have to follow depending on the area you live in. However, since measuring noise requires scientific instruments (such as a sound level meter), you may not always know if you are exceeding the noise limits for a particular area. In such cases, you should:\n\n- Make sure that regardless of what you do or which equipment you use, it does not turn out to benoisy and a disturbance for others.For example, if you are playing music during a party, try to keep the volume down at night time while people are sleeping.\n- Don’t wait for your neighbours or people around you to file a complaint to the police. If they mention that you are making noise that is disturbing them, try toreduce the noise.\n\nPlease note that it does not matter whether you made the noise unintentionally or intentionally; all that matters is whether you have created too much noise.\n\nIf any noise causes you annoyance, discomfort or any injury, then you can file acomplaintwith the police or your State’s Pollution Control Board. Otherwise, you can also complain if you know that the noise5. level is disturbing you or it happensat night between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am.",

Only a Court can declare a person to be of unsound mind5.\n\nCapacity to Make Treatment Decisions\n\nThe capacity to make mental healthcare-related decisions depends on the conditions given above6:\n\n- The ability to understandrelevant informationon mental healthcare related issues, such as admission, personal assistance or treatment. Please note the information given to the person has to be comprehensible. For example, Ram cannot hear properly.

For example, against the wishes of his parents, Ram decides not to go to a mental health establishment. The sole fact that Ram’s parents think that a decision is inappropriate does not mean they do not have the capacity to make such a decision.",

However, no one can be denied or discriminated against while providing medical treatment  based only on their gender or sexual orientation. The Government has to2provide specific healthcare services and ensure access to existing ones for transgender persons. For instance, ensuring non-discrimination against a transgender person by denying or discontinuing healthcare services or unfair treatment to them.3.Doing so will be punishable with jail term between 6 months to 2 years, with a fine.4.\n\nPlease seehereto know what you can do if you face any harassment.

However,a persondoes not haveto go through any surgeries to be given recognition with their self-identified gender.1. In this regard, given below are two of the most common forms of surgeries performed:\n\n- Gender Affirmative Therapy (GAT)is a set of procedures, from psychological counselling to sex reassignment surgeries, which aim to change a persons appearance so that it will conform more strongly with the self-identified gender.  For example, Rita was identified to be female at birth, but while growing up, identifies herself as male, and may undergo GAT to masculinize her appearance through breast removal surgery, etc.\n\nThe Supreme Court1has held that it is a constitutional right for a person to be affirmed as male or female after the respective GAT, and that there is no impediment, legal or otherwise, in undergoing GAT.\n\n- Corrective surgery/intersex surgeryrefers to procedures done to modify sex characteristics and genitals when they are anomalous, meaning when there is no clear distinction between male and female genitals.  For example, a child, Nakul, is born with both male and female genitalia, and decides that he self-identifies and feels that his gender is male, and thus, undergoes corrective surgery to align more strongly to the male gender.\n\nThough nation-wide regulations do not exist, some states, like Tamil Nadu, have banned unnecessary medical procedures on infants, to prevent illegal corrective surgery at a young age2.\n\nIn India, there are no guidelines for eligibility, procedure, etc. or laws on GAT or Corrective Surgery.\n\nIf a person faces any discrimination while accessing medical or psychological healthcare, they can take action to alleviate the problem.

Parents of children belonging to disadvantaged groups should get representation in theSchool Management Committeesin proportion to the number of such students enrolled.1Specified category schools and unaided private schools are mandated to admit in first class (Class 1), children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groups to a minimum of 25% of the class size.2\n\nWhile children belonging to disadvantaged groups earlier did not extend to children with HIV, the Supreme Court of India ordered that the State Governments should consider adding children living with or affected by HIV to disadvantaged groups by way of notification givenhere.3Consequently, children with HIV are counted under disadvantaged groups for the Right to Education in Union Territories of Chandigarh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.4Karnataka also includes children with HIV under disadvantaged groups. More states may include children with HIV or affected by HIV in the disadvantaged groups for the purpose of RTE.5\n\nChildren belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are also included under the category of disadvantaged groups in the RTE law. Certain states in India give priority to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in case of 25% admissions to disadvantaged categories in specific categories and unaided private schools. For example, the state of Haryana6provides for a reservation of 5% seats out of the 25% admissions for Scheduled Castes. Similarly, the state of Karnataka has 7.5% and 1.5% seats EWS seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively.7\n\nAll children, who are citizens of India have a right to education, including children with disabilities. The Constitution of India provides that nobody can be denied admission into any educational institution based on their religion, race, caste or language8Moreover, the State is directed to provide free and compulsory education for all until the age of 14 years and no child can be denied admission to any educational institution maintained by state funds on grounds such as religion, race, caste or language.9\n\nA child with a disability has special rights for getting an education. Some of these are:\n\nAlso, the government has to take special steps to help children with disabilities get an education including:\n\n- Provision of safe transport facilities to enable them to attend school and complete elementary education.11\n- Materials for special learning and educational support.12\n- Provision of scholarships, part-time classes, informal education and make it easier for such children to give exams etc. A child with 80% disability or two or more disabilities can choose to be educated at home.13",

            "content": "All children between the ages of6 to 14 yearscan get education from schools, free of cost,  from the 1st standard (first class) till the 8th standard (eighth class).\n\nChildren can attend classes in neighbourhood schools. These neighbourhood schools are schools established within a walking distance of:\n\n- one kilometre from the child’s neighbourhood (if the child is in class I to V) and\n- three kilometres (if the child is in class VI to VIII).1\n\nHowever, the law does not restrict the education of children to neighbourhood schools.2The child isfree to enrol in any schooldespite the distance from the child’s neighbourhood to receive an education free of cost. However, it is important to note that a child can receive education only from thoseschoolsestablished, owned (e.g. state established schools like Kendriya Vidyalaya, Aarohi schools in Haryana etc.), controlled or substantially funded directly or indirectly by the government or local authority. So if a child is admitted to schools other than those given above, their parents cannot make a claim for reimbursement of expenses for the child’s education.3This, however, does not include admissions under the25% reserved admissions for disadvantaged groups.4The admission process for schools covered by the Right to Education varies from state to state. However, certain practices are common. For admitting a child to the school, the following are the common practices across states:\n\nParents are required to fill a form provided by the requisite state governments. These forms are available on the government portal as every state has a separate portal for admissions. Some examples arePunjab,Maharashtraetc. You can also approach neighbourhood schools to obtain the form.5The form includes basic information like the family details, address etc. It also provides for choosing preferred schools in case of unplanned admissions. A maximum of five schools can be provided as preferences.6\n\nCertain documents are mandatory to be submitted. These documents include the child’s ID asproof of age(may entail a birth certificate, Anganwadi record,Aadhar cardetc.) and parents’ IDs. Forms also enlist the provision of documents such as the family’sration card, income certificate, caste certificate as well as relevant certificates highlighting the special needs of children. Such a filled form may ordinarily be submitted to the neighbourhood school. Since certain states have made the entire process online, so the application may be carried on the government portal.\n\nChildren can get admission to schools without paying any fees or expenses.7The right to education law in India prohibits invocation of any fees prior to the admission of a child. No school is allowed to charge any capitation fee which refers to any kind of donation or payment other than the school fee.8\n\nMoreover, schools cannot subject the child or the parents to any form of screening procedure before admission.A screening procedure may involve any test or interview of the child or the parent for the purposes of admission to the school.9The school should randomly select the children and employ an open lottery method for filling up vacant seats. This can be done in the form of writing the names of the children on paper slips and then randomly picking them out of a container to ensure transparency. Schools may be fined up to Rs.25,000 for the first contravention of this provision and may extend to Rs.50,000 for any subsequent contraventions.9",

For instance, these services include, the supply of water to homes, supply of electricity, the postal system, the banking system, railways, etc. The consumer protection law enables consumers to file complaints about these public utility services.\n\nSome examples of public utility services include(( Section 22A(b), Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.)):\n\n- Transport service for carrying passengers or goods by air, road or water\n- Postal services\n- Telephone services\n- Power facilities\n- Lighting facilities\n- Water facilities\n- Insurance service\n\nThe law recognizes public utility services as “establishments” under the law. This means that the local branch offices of a public utility service which are establishments, can be held liable in the same way as its main central authority. For example, if one has a complaint against the local water department, one can file a complaint against the local/district department itself, and not against theCentral Water Commission. Other than the mainstream consumer protection laws in India, Permanent Lok Adalats can also be approached to request for good standards of public utility services at a district level(( Section 22B, Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.)).\n\nIf someone is obstructing, stopping or not providing you with a public utility service, you can file a complaint with theNational Government Services Portal. The Portal, though not exclusively dedicated to consumer services, has a wide range of public services against which consumers can file grievances. Issues such as commodity rates (prices of gold, silver etc.), monitoring ration cards, etc. can easily be done by visiting theNational Government Services Portal.  Among other things, the portal provides a user with information on the consumer complaint forum, state- wise break up on details of the Public Distribution System etc. Even complaints about the Bureau of Indian Standards can be filedhere. This means that consumers can file a complaint about the quality of a BIS-certified product, Hallmarked products, misleading advertisements about the BIS standard, etc.(( Consumer Protection, Bureau of Indian Standards, accessed at https://bis.gov.in/other/consumer_affairs.htm#:~:text=%2D%20Through%20Online%20Complaint%20Registration%20on,Head%20(Consumer%20Affairs%20Department).))\n\nThe Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances’ (CPGRAMS)portalis very useful to file complaints about  postal services, telecommunication, banking services, insurance services, school and education, road transport, natural gas, etc.\n\n- Thepostal departmentdeals with issues such as delay, non-delivery, pensions, insurance (postal service),corruptioncharges, e-commerce related problems, AADHAR related issues, etc.\n- Thetelecom departmentdeals with issues related to mobile, broadband, landline, pension, employee, malpractices and corruption.

Complaints can also be filed to theBanking Ombudsmen, who are senior officials appointed by the RBI to redress customer complaints against deficiency in certain banking services.\n\nSome states such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have implemented electricity callservicesfor making complaints about electricity service.

It is from this amount thatdeductionsare made. Read morehere.\n\nCertain entities as well as certain kinds of income are exempt from tax. In other words, income tax will not be charged to such entities and incomes. Some examples include agricultural income, income for scholarships for higher education etc. Read morehere.\n\nA deduction is an expense that is subtracted from an individual’sgross total incometo reduce the amount which is going to be taxed. Deductions can be less than, more than or equal to the amount of income. If the amount deductible is more than the amount of income, then the resulting amount will be taken as a loss while calculating taxes.(( Section 80A, Section – 80AA, Section – 80AB, Section – 80AC, Section 80B, Section 80C, Section 80CC, Section 80CCA, Section – 80CCB of the Income Tax Act, 1961))Some of the deductions for individuals include income from a loan taken for house property, income from loans taken for higher education etc. Read morehere.\n\nTaxes are collected by the Government through:\n\nTaxpayers can voluntarily pay income tax by going to designated banks.

The company will deposit the deducted money to the government. The person whose tax has been deducted at source will get aForm 26ASorTDSCertificate. This will be given to the person by the entity or person deducting the tax. For example,  XYZ Company will deduct an amount for tax before giving Aman his monthly salary, and provide Aman with the TDS Certificate.\n\nTax collected at source (TCS)((Section 206C, Income Tax Act, 1961)) TDS is the tax payable by a seller, which he collects from the buyer at the time of sale. For example, in a parking area of a shopping mall, along with the parking fee, the mall will charge a tax amount for a parking lot. Some other instances where sellers collect TCS are for liquor, while selling a motor vehicle, jewellery, etc.\n\nIt ismandatoryfor a taxpayer to have aPAN Cardas well as anAadhar Cardwhile filing taxes.",

Broadly, it can be said that services include:\n\n- Business services: Business services are services that support the daily functioning and activity of any business, such as technological setup, website hosting, call centers, banking, transport service, telecom etc.\n- Personal services:Personal services are usually more individualistic in nature, such as catering, hotel accommodation, medicine, painting, sculpting etc.\n- Social services:Social services are usually funded by the Government, and include services such as housing, medical care to the underprivileged, primaryeducationetc.\n\nFurther, services that arefree of charge(( Section 2(42), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)),  are usually not covered under consumer protection laws(( Joint Labour Commissioner and Registering Officer and Another v. Kesar Lal, AIR 2020 SC 2596.)). In other words, unpaid services which are provided informally, rather than with an expectation of a fee, are not covered under consumer protection law. For example, if someone goes to a doctor for a medical check-up, but being an acquaintance, the doctor does not charge any fee, the patient cannot later sue the doctor for any deficiency of service, as it had been provided free of charge. However, a traveller buying a ticket for a train is a consumer, and can sue the railways for any deficiency of service including bad food service, bad hygiene standards etc((Commentary on Consumer Protection Act, National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, accessed at, http://ncdrc.nic.in/bare_acts/1_1_2.html.\n\n",

The CCPA can begin to inquire into the mentioned issues either when they receive complaints, or on their own.\n\nThe Central Consumer Protection Council has advisory functions, giving suggestions about the promotion and protection of consumer rights. Similarly, state-level units called State Consumer Protection Councils and District Consumer Protection Councils are also formed which perform similar advisory functions.

Some of the acts considered as ragging are:(( Section 3, theUGC Regulations On Curbing The Menace Of Ragging In Higher Educational Institutions, 2009.))\n\nPsychological Harm\n\nCausing psychological harm to a student is considered to be ragging under the law. This may include:\n\n- Any written, verbal or behavioural actions by a student including teasing a student, speaking rudely, etc. For example, calling a student derogatory names.\n- Rowdy or undisciplined behaviour which may annoy the student, cause hardship or psychological harm to any student. For example, stealing and throwing away the notebooks that belong to a student or threatening a student constantly.\n- Asking a student to do an act which he would not ordinarily do. Such incidents may cause a sense of shame, torment or embarrassment to the student thereby affecting his psychological wellbeing. For example, making a student dance in front of the class.\n- Any act that affects the mental health and self-confidence of any student. For example, making a student dance in front of the class and ridiculing him for it.\n- An act or abuse, whether written, verbal or online (emails, posts, etc.), which would result in making a student uncomfortable. For example, spreading rumours on online platforms about a student or ragging for the sake of deriving pleasure out of it.\n\nDisturbing Academic Activity\n\nRagging can take the form of disturbing a student’s academics. If any student prevents, disrupts or disturbs the regular academic activity of  another student, it is ragging. For example, a senior student harassing a junior student into not attending classes.\n\nUsing or Exploiting a Student\n\nRagging can take the form of exploitation of another student. This includes:\n\n- Exploiting the services of any student for completing the academic tasks assigned to an individual/group. For example, making a student do some other student’s homework assignments.\n- Financial extortion or forceful expenditure put on any student.  For example, making a student pay for another student’s expenses.\n\nPhysical Abuse\n\nRagging can take the form of physical abuse and violence. Ragging includes:\n\n- Rowdy behaviour or indiscipline which is likely to cause physical harm  to any student, or any act which makes one fearful/apprehensive of physical harm. For example, threatening to beat up a student.\n- Asking a student to do an act which he would not ordinarily do, and which causes him a sense of shame, torment or embarrassment so as to adversely affect his physical well-being. For example, beating up a student because he did not comply with the orders of a senior to perform a task.\n- Sexual abuse, including assaults, stripping, forcing obscene and lewd acts or gestures, etc. For example, asking a female student to strip.\n- Any act which causes bodily harm or any other danger to a student. For example, mixing laxatives in a student’s food.\n\nDiscriminating against Another Student\n\nRagging can take the form of discrimination and prejudice against another student. Any abuse based on the colour of your skin, race, religion, caste, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, nationality, regional origins, linguistic identity, place of birth, place of residence or economic background, is considered as ragging. For example, if a student is constantly teased and called names based on her regional origins, or is ridiculed because she belongs to a lower socioeconomic status than other students, it can be considered as ragging.\n\nThe intent behind ragging does not matter. For example, to derive pleasure, for fun, to show off authority or superiority – the very act of ragging is a crime under Indian law.\n\nIf you are being ragged, you cancomplainto college authorities or the police.",

For example, only citizens of India can contest in elections.1\n\nProof of Citizenship\n\nIn India, the government has not mandated that citizens should hold any particular document to be regarded as Indian citizens, except in Assam. Indian citizens may choose which proof(s) of identification they want to acquire, based on the services that card/document provides. For instance, one must have aPAN Cardto be able to file income tax returns or aVoter ID Cardto vote in elections, but the government does not mandatorily require you to possess any of these proofs of identification.\n\nHowever, please note that noproof of identification, such asAadhar,Passport, is a conclusive proof of citizenship in India.\n\nAcquiring Indian Citizenship\n\nUnder the law, you are considered an Indian citizen if you are born in India and fall in one of the 3 categories below:2\n\n- If you were born between 26th January 1950 to 1st July 1987: You are a citizen irrespective of the nationality of your parents.\n- If you were born between 1st July 1987 to 3rd December 2004:  One of your parents should have been an Indian citizen when you are born\n- If you were born on or after 3rd December 2004: Both your parents must be  Indian citizens; or if only one of your parents is a citizen, then the other is not an illegal immigrant\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was notified in March 2024. It offers a fast track to citizenship for persecuted minorities (Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Jain, and Christian) from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.  They can apply for citizenship through a simplified process if they can show evidence of religious persecution in their home country.The residency requirement for these minorities seeking citizenship has been reduced to 6 years, as opposed to the standard 11 years required for naturalization under other circumstances.\n\nThere are three other procedures that can be followed to become an Indian citizen i.e. bydescent,naturalizationand registration.3Through these, you can also acquire Indian citizenship if you were born outside India in certain cases. Indian residents and others, who are not citizens by birth, canapplyfor Indian citizenship.\n\nTermination of Indian Citizenship\n\nYour status as an Indian citizen can be terminated if:\n\n- You give up your Indian citizenship.4\n- You voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country.5\n\nFurthermore,  if you are not born as an Indian citizen and have acquired citizenship by naturalisation or registration under certain circumstances, then the Government  may deprive you of your status as an Indian citizen:\n\n- If you show yourself to bedisloyaltowards the Constitution of India,6\n- If your citizenship  was obtainedfraudulently, by false representation or by not revealing crucial facts,7etc.\n- If, during any war India is engaged in, you have unlawfully traded or communicated with an enemy, or knowingly associated with any business assisting the enemy,8\n- If you weresentenced to jail in any countryfor at least 2 years, within 5 years of being registered/naturalized as an Indian citizen,9\n- If you have beenresiding out of India for more than 7 years continuously, without being enrolled in any educational institute in that country, or in the service of Government of India, or an international organization of which India is a member.

If the commission does not respond in the specified time, the complaint will be accepted and looked into by the District Commissions(( Section 36(2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). Before rejecting a complaint, the commission must give the complainant the opportunity to be heard. The Commission has the power to order for the removal of any problems or defects from the goods or services availed, or it can order a payment of fine(( Section 39, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.))as a relief to the complainant. The parties to a case also have the option to file an appeal against the order of the District Commission to the State Commission within 45 days of the District Commission order(( Section 41, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). You can find details of the district commissions given in the National Consumer Redressalwebsite.\n\nState Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC)\n\nThe State Commission is a state-level complaint redressal forum located at the capital(( Section 42(2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.))of the respective state where complaints with respect to goods having value between Rupees 1 crore to 10 crores can be filed. There are about 35state commissionsin the country where complaints, appeals from the District Commission, and cases about unfair contracts are heard(( Section 47(1), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). An appeal against the decision of the State Commission can be filed with the National Commission, within 30 days from the date of the order(( Section 51, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). Once such an appeal is filed, it is required to be decided within 90 days by the National Commission(( Section 52, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)).\n\nNational Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC):\n\nThe National Commission is the upper-most authority for consumer complaints redressals. It is located at New Delhi(( Section 53(2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). Complaints about goods or services whose value is above Rupees 10 crores, and appeals against the orders of the State Commission or the Central Consumer Protection Authority, can be filed with the NCDRC(( Section 58(1), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). An appeal against the decision of the National Commission can be filed with the Supreme Court within a period of 30 days from the date of the order passed(( Section 67, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). The orders of the Commission are published on itswebsite. The Commission has the legal right to publish the orders and no proceedings can be brought against the Commission for publishing these orders(( Rule 12(8), Consumer Protection (Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020.)). The National Commission portal also provides video instructions pertaining to registration and filing of an electroniccomplaintthrough its forum.\n\nTime for deciding complaints\n\nA consumer complaint must be decided by the Commissions within a period of 3 months. This may be extended to 5 months in case there is a requirement for testing of the products/defects(( Section 38(7), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)).\n\nAppeals for orders passed by Commissions\n\nThe order passed by the Commissions are final if they have not been appealed in the specified period of time(( Section 68, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). This rule has exceptions, as the Commission can accept cases for which appeals were not filed in the prescribed time.  Besides these provisions, the cases can be transferred from one district commission to another and from one State Commission to another by the State1and National Commissions(( Section 62, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.))respectively, if and when the parties apply.\n\nA consumer who has filed a complaint with any of the forums given above, can track their case through the Online Case Statusportal.

The punishment is:\n\n- For the first offence: A fine which may extend up to Rs. 10 lakh and jail time up to 2 years5(( Section 89 & Section 21 (2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- For every repeat offence: A fine which may extend up toRs. 50 lakh and jail time up to 5 yearsmay be awarded(( Section 89 & Section 21 (2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- The Central Authority can also prohibit them from endorsinganyproduct for up to1 year. In case of subsequent offences, it can be extended up to 3 years(( Section 21(3), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- Failure to comply with these directions of theCentral Authoritycan result in jail time for up to6 months or a fine extending to Rs. 20 lakh((Section 88,Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n\n\n\nAny action of the manufacturer or retailer involving the sale, import, storage or distribution of adulterated food is punishable. The following punishments apply:\n\n- When there is no injury((Section 2(23), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))to the consumer, like any kind of pain or death, jail time for up to 6 months and a fine of up to Rs. 1 lakh may be granted((Section 90(1)(a), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- When the injury does not amount to grievous hurt to the consumer, jail time for up to 1 year and a fine of up to Rs. 3 lakhs may be granted((Section 90(1)(b), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- When thereisgrievous hurt to the consumer, jail time for up to 7 years and a fine of up to Rs. 5 lakhs may be granted((Section 90(1)(c), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- When the adulteration has caused the death of the consumer, jail time for not less than 7 years and extending up to life, and a fine of not less than Rs. 10 lakhs may be granted((Section 90(1)(d), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n\nAdditionally, the Consumer Authority may suspend the license of the manufacturer for up to 2 years, when it is the first offence or cancel the license of such manufacturer altogether if the offence is repeated((Section 90(3), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n\nSpurious goods are those which are falsely claimed to be genuine((Section 2(43), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))or are fake or imitative of real, original goods.

It includes the production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery of goods and services byelectronic means(( Electronic Commerce, WTO, accessed at https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/mc11_e/briefing_notes_e/bfecom_e.htm#:~:text=Electronic%20commerce%2C%20or%20e%2Dcommerce,and%20services%20by%20electronic%20means%22.&text=These%20WTO%20bodies%20were%20instructed,WTO%20agreements%20and%20e%2Dcommerce.)).\n\nE-commerce entities, such as online shopping websites like Flipkart(( Ajay Kumar v. Flipkart Internet Private Limited, 2018 SCC OnLine NCDRC 549.))and Amazon(( Kent RO Systems v. Amazon Seller Services, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 8016.)), have long been treated as service providers who work for a profit(( Rediff.Com India Limited v. Ms. Urmil Munjal, 2013(2) C.P.C. 536.)). They have been held liable whenever there has been a violation of consumer rights. One of the major reforms brought about by the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 is that it lays down a set of rules to govern these e-commerce entities(( Consumer Protection (E-Commerce Rules), 2020.)):\n\n- E-commerce entities will have to respond within 48 hours of complaint.\n- Complaints can be made from any place, regardless of where the purchase was made.\n- E-commerce entities such as Amazon, Flipkart, are now required to display the details of the sellers, such as their legal name, geographic address, contact details, etc.\n- These entities must not directly or indirectly manipulate the goods’ prices, and must not adopt any unfair or deceptive methods of sale.\n- They are prohibited from exaggerating the qualities of a product, and posting fake reviews.\n- The law mandates the protection of consumers’ personal information so that personal details are kept confidential and the privacy of consumers is protected.\n\nAn advertisement is a promotion through television, radio, or any other electronic media, newspapers, banners, posters, handbills, wall-writing etc. A misleading advertisement says untrue things about the goods and services, which can mislead the consumer in  buying them(( Misleading Advertisements, Department of Consumer Affairs, accessed at https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/more/misleading-advertisements. These advertisements may make false claims about a product or services’ usefulness((Section 2(47)(f), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)), quality and quantity(( Section 2(28)(ii), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)), or deliberately conceal important information about the product(( Section 2(28)(iv), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))(such as known side-effects), etc. Advertisers can be sued for making misleading claims in their advertisements. These include claims of being the first toothpaste to have a certain beneficial composition when it actually isn’t(( Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. v. Anchor Health & Beauty Care P. Ltd., (2008) 7 MLJ 1119.)), or advertising schemes that seek to increase profits without passing on the benefit to the consumers(( Society of Catalysts v. Vodafone Essar Mobile Services Limited, LNIND 2008 SCDRCD 962.)), etc.\n\nUnfair trade practices have a broad definition under the consumer protection law. They include false statements about the goods’ standard, quality and quantity, and the marketing of used/second-hand goods as new goods. It also includes false claims about a warranty, or the warranty period being scientifically untested, etc. This has resulted in several lawsuits, one involving a noodle-maker labelling its packets with false lead content(( M/S Nestle India Limited v. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, W.P. L. No. 1688 of 2015.)), replacing the labels of pharmaceutical drugs to extend the expiry period(( Pooja Roy v. Krishnango Bhattacharya, C.R.R 2796 of 2008, Calcutta H.C.)), marketing adulterated goods with different ingredients than stated on the label(( Consumer Guidance Society v. Amway India Enterprises, (2007) C.C 140 of 2007.)), etc.\n\nRestrictive trade practice means a trade practice which tends to manipulate the price, or delivery, of goods, which affect the flow of supplies in the market. This leads to the consumers facing unfair costs or restrictions. This is usually done in some of the following ways: price fixing, dealing exclusively, restricting the resale values of sold goods, mandating that buying one good or service entails buying other goods or services. One real-life example of this is the inbuilt price of delivery and fixing electronic goods. This ensures that the consumer ends up paying for the service, whether they want to or not, making them bear unfair costs.\n\nDefective goods are goods(( Sections 2(10) and 2(11), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.))with any fault, imperfection or shortcoming in the quality, quantity, purity or standard which is required to be maintained by the seller, under the law in force. Some examples are adulterated or imperfectly brewed beverages, malfunctioning machinery, misshapen artifacts, etc.\n\nSpurious goods are those which are falsely claimed to be genuine(( Section 2(43), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))or are fake or imitative of real, original goods. These are often of inferior quality and infringe upon the trademarks and copyrights of legal owners of the original goods. A crucial example is that of medicines or cheap make-up products found in local markets. Often, spurious medicines are marketed under another drug’s name, or imitate/substitute another drug in a deceptive way(( Drugs and Cosmetics FAQs, Integrated Grievance Redressal Mechanism, accessed at https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/faq-details.php?fid=Drugs%20and%20Cosmetics.)).\n\nOvercharging generally occurs in covert ways, when sellers charge the consumer more than what is prescribed as the Maximum Retail Price of a product. It is a gross violation of consumer rights.\n\nPresently, the law also addresses grievances related to food products. For example, customers can file their grievances about packaged food like the presence of adulterant, expired goods, missing FSSAI license, etc. or serving issues like the lack of hygiene, presence of pests, etc. at the Food Safety ConnectPortal.\n\n",

For instance, ensuring non-discrimination against a transgender person by denying or discontinuing healthcare services or unfair treatment to them.3.Doing so will be punishable with jail term between 6 months to 2 years, with a fine.4.\n\nPlease seehereto know what you can do if you face any harassment.

Thus, most Muslim marriages are guided by customs derived from interpretations followed through generations. The laws and customs that apply to each person following Islam differ based on the sect of the person. Further, different branches of customs have emerged within sects. These branches have specific laws known as “Schools of Law”.((Mulla, D. F., Sir. (n.d.).Principles of Mahomedan Law(20th ed.) p.28.))\n\n\n\nIn India,((Consultation Paper on Reform of Family Law, Law Commission, available at https://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/CPonReformFamilyLaw.pdf.)) parts of Muslim personal law were written down in 1937 as the Muslim Personal Law (Shariat) Application Act, 1937 as well as the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act,1939. These two laws in many ways have led the reforms in family laws. However, Muslim marriages are guided by the Islamic religious precepts. In Islam, there are two sects- Sunni and Shia. Each sect practices different schools of law. This means that depending on the sect, the marriage procedure differs for a bride and a groom.((Mulla, D. F., Sir.

            "content": "When it comes to immovable property, inheritance refers to the transfer of a property’s ownership after the death of an individual. The ideal way to ensure smooth transfer of property ownership following someone’s death is through a will. To know more about wills, read ourexplainer.\n\nHowever, if there is no will, i.e., an intestacy, law of inheritance applies to decide distribution of the property. In India, personal laws, customary laws and legislative laws govern the law of inheritance of property. The broad laws are the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and Islamic personal laws.\n\nUnder the Hindu law of inheritance, a person/owner can deal with their self-acquired property as they like, but there are restrictions about transfer of ancestral property. The law gives certain family members a birthright to ancestral properties. Brothers and sisters are entitled to equal shares in the property of their mother or father under the Hindu law of inheritance. Here, the terms ‘son’ and ‘daughter’ include adopted sons and daughters, but not stepchildren.\n\nIf the survivors have a dispute over immovable property, and the owner of the property does not have a will, they can file a suit before court.\n\nIn the case of Muslim law of inheritance, the personal laws that apply depend on which sub-sect one belongs to, i.e., Sunni or Shia. The laws are not codified, which means that there is no act setting them down. For Sunnis following Hanafi Law, personal law restricts legacies to a maximum of one-third of the estate remaining after taking care of funeral expenses, outstanding wages of domestic servants and debts.",

It follows the same format as that of a partition deed. It is not mandatory to register and stamp the family settlement agreement. However, all family members should sign it voluntarily, that is, without any fraud or coercion or undue pressure from any family member or anyone.\n\nPartition Suit\n\nA suit for partition of property, is a court case filed when the family members cannot agree on the terms and conditions of dividing the property. In such cases, the family members usually want to divide the property according to their shares in it. The first step here is to carefully draft and send a legal notice to the other legal heirs of the property related to family property partition/ settlement.",

The purpose of this law is to prohibit coercion during the gift exchange.\n\nGifts from the bride’s side should be according to custom and as per financial capacity of her family. For example, in marriages in certain societies, sarees and jewellery are given to women relatives of both the bride and groom, by the other side. This is done as per custom and therefore would not be considered as dowry. There may be other customs of giving certain gifts.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the groom’s family cannot force a bride to give the gifts per the custom as this would be demanding dowry. Generally, gifts given should be of a value which do not create an extraordinary financial burden to the person giving them.(( Provision to Section 3, Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961)) For example, if the bride’s father has to take a loan of a significant amount to buy gifts for the groom’s side, then it cannot be said that the gift has been given as per financial capacity of the person. This could be a case of an excessive financial burden on him and could be seen as a case of dowry.",

            "content": "All children between the ages of6 to 14 yearscan get education from schools, free of cost,  from the 1st standard (first class) till the 8th standard (eighth class).\n\nChildren can attend classes in neighbourhood schools. These neighbourhood schools are schools established within a walking distance of:\n\n- one kilometre from the child’s neighbourhood (if the child is in class I to V) and\n- three kilometres (if the child is in class VI to VIII).1\n\nHowever, the law does not restrict the education of children to neighbourhood schools.2The child isfree to enrol in any schooldespite the distance from the child’s neighbourhood to receive an education free of cost. However, it is important to note that a child can receive education only from thoseschoolsestablished, owned (e.g. state established schools like Kendriya Vidyalaya, Aarohi schools in Haryana etc.), controlled or substantially funded directly or indirectly by the government or local authority. So if a child is admitted to schools other than those given above, their parents cannot make a claim for reimbursement of expenses for the child’s education.3This, however, does not include admissions under the25% reserved admissions for disadvantaged groups.4The admission process for schools covered by the Right to Education varies from state to state. However, certain practices are common. For admitting a child to the school, the following are the common practices across states:\n\nParents are required to fill a form provided by the requisite state governments. These forms are available on the government portal as every state has a separate portal for admissions. Some examples arePunjab,Maharashtraetc. You can also approach neighbourhood schools to obtain the form.5The form includes basic information like the family details, address etc. It also provides for choosing preferred schools in case of unplanned admissions. A maximum of five schools can be provided as preferences.6\n\nCertain documents are mandatory to be submitted. These documents include the child’s ID asproof of age(may entail a birth certificate, Anganwadi record,Aadhar cardetc.) and parents’ IDs. Forms also enlist the provision of documents such as the family’sration card, income certificate, caste certificate as well as relevant certificates highlighting the special needs of children. Such a filled form may ordinarily be submitted to the neighbourhood school. Since certain states have made the entire process online, so the application may be carried on the government portal.\n\nChildren can get admission to schools without paying any fees or expenses.7The right to education law in India prohibits invocation of any fees prior to the admission of a child. No school is allowed to charge any capitation fee which refers to any kind of donation or payment other than the school fee.8\n\nMoreover, schools cannot subject the child or the parents to any form of screening procedure before admission.A screening procedure may involve any test or interview of the child or the parent for the purposes of admission to the school.9The school should randomly select the children and employ an open lottery method for filling up vacant seats. This can be done in the form of writing the names of the children on paper slips and then randomly picking them out of a container to ensure transparency. Schools may be fined up to Rs.25,000 for the first contravention of this provision and may extend to Rs.50,000 for any subsequent contraventions.9",

However, there are certain circumstances where the landlord can evict you from the house. To do so, the landlord must make an application to an authority under this law called the Rent Controller, to evict you.\n\nSome of the reasons for which a landlord can apply to evict you if you have a rent/lease agreement are mentioned below:\n\n- You havenot paid rentfor two months after receiving a demand notice from the landlord.\n- You havesublet the house, either in part or full, to someone else without the consent of the landlord.\n- You have used the house for apurpose otherthan that for which you rented it, and in this process caused public nuisance, damage to the premises, or harmed the interest of the landlord.\n- Neither you nor your family members have been living in the house for6 months or more. (If you have rented a house for residential purpose and are using it for commercial purposes, then it will be counted as not living in the house)\n- You have caused substantial damage to the house.\n- The landlord wants torepair, rebuild or reconstruct his property, but cannot do it with tenants living there.\n- The house has becomeunsafe for human habitationand the landlord must carry out the repairs.\n\nIt is important to note that the reasons for eviction may differ from state to state. But largely the principles of eviction stay the same. The landlord must have a reasonable ground within the bounds of the law to evict you. If you feel that you have been unjustly evicted by your landlord, please contact a lawyer for further help.\n\nA leave and license agreement will have a provision for the licensor (person giving out the property) to give a one month notice to get the licensee (person staying in the property) to leave their property. There are no other protections available under the law for this type of agreement unless explicitly mentioned in the contract.",

The State of Maharashtra and Ors 2014 ALL MR (Cri) 636; Rupali Devi v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors.  (2019) 5 SCC 384.)), or that you are residing with him when the violence took place.(( Lalita Toppo v. State of Jharkhand & Anr.  2018 (4) RCR (Criminal) 976.)) You just need to have shared a household with the harasserat some point of time.\n\nIn order to seek relief and protection from domestic violence, you need to have adomestic relationshipwith your abuser, in addition to having a shared household with them. For example, if you have lived with your mother-in-law in the same house, and you are being subjected to domestic violence, you can seek relief and protection, as it means that you had a domestic relationship with the harasser and lived with her in a shared household.\n\nHowever, if you have merely lived in a shared household, but did not share a domestic relationship with the harasser, you cannot file a complaint against domestic violence. For example, if you have a servant who resides in your house, and he beats you up, you cannot file a complaint under this law against him, as you do not have adomestic relationshipwith him.\n\nTo claim relief and protection, it does not matter if you have a legal share in the house. This household can be owned/leased by either you, the harasser , or the both of you, and also includes households that belong to the joint family of which the harasser is a part, even if you do not have a legal right in it.\n\nHowever, if the property is the exclusive, personal property of the parents-in-law, or any other relative of the harasser, you do not have a right to claim any share in that house, as that is not a shared household.(( S.R. Batra v. Taruna Batra (2007) 3 SCC 169.))  However, the Court will ultimately decide whether or not to allow you to reside in a particular house according to the facts of the case, so you may be allowed to reside in a house owned by your mother-in-law in some cases.  Seeherefor more details on residence orders.\n\nPlease note that it is not necessary that the violence has taken place only in the house where you reside; it can take placeanywhere.\n\nSome states provide handbooks for ASHA workers where you can find more information on forms on violence, where it can happen and how to file a complaint to seek protection against domestic violence.

            "content": "Income tax is a tax levied by the Government of India on theincomeof every person. TheIncome Tax Act, 1961, covers legal provisions regarding the collection of income tax.​There are some important points you will need to keep in mind to understand income tax, such as:\n\nIt is mandatory for every person to pay income tax. Income tax law defines the term ‘person’(( Section 2(31), Income Tax Act, 1961))to include individuals, Hindu Undivided Family etc. Read morehere.\n\n​​The Income Tax Department taxes you based on your income from categories such as income from salaries etc. The total income calculated from these heads is called thegross total income. It is from this amount thatdeductionsare made. Read morehere.\n\nCertain entities as well as certain kinds of income are exempt from tax. In other words, income tax will not be charged to such entities and incomes. Some examples include agricultural income, income for scholarships for higher education etc. Read morehere.\n\nA deduction is an expense that is subtracted from an individual’sgross total incometo reduce the amount which is going to be taxed. Deductions can be less than, more than or equal to the amount of income. If the amount deductible is more than the amount of income, then the resulting amount will be taken as a loss while calculating taxes.(( Section 80A, Section – 80AA, Section – 80AB, Section – 80AC, Section 80B, Section 80C, Section 80CC, Section 80CCA, Section – 80CCB of the Income Tax Act, 1961))Some of the deductions for individuals include income from a loan taken for house property, income from loans taken for higher education etc. Read morehere.\n\nTaxes are collected by the Government through:\n\nTaxpayers can voluntarily pay income tax by going to designated banks. For example, taxpayers can payadvance taxandself-assessment taxin authorized bank branches such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Syndicate Bank, Allahabad Bank, State Bank of India, etc.\n\nWhen tax is collected from the very source of income of the person receiving income, it is known as‘taxes deducted at source’ or TDS.(( Tax Deducted At Source, Income Tax Department, available at https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Pages/Deposit_TDS_TCS.aspx For example, if you are a professional earning a retainership fee in a company, a certain amount may be deducted by your company as tax when it is given to you. The company will deposit the deducted money to the government. The person whose tax has been deducted at source will get aForm 26ASorTDSCertificate. This will be given to the person by the entity or person deducting the tax. For example,  XYZ Company will deduct an amount for tax before giving Aman his monthly salary, and provide Aman with the TDS Certificate.\n\nTax collected at source (TCS)((Section 206C, Income Tax Act, 1961)) TDS is the tax payable by a seller, which he collects from the buyer at the time of sale. For example, in a parking area of a shopping mall, along with the parking fee, the mall will charge a tax amount for a parking lot. Some other instances where sellers collect TCS are for liquor, while selling a motor vehicle, jewellery, etc.\n\nIt ismandatoryfor a taxpayer to have aPAN Cardas well as anAadhar Cardwhile filing taxes.",

Some of the acts considered as ragging are:(( Section 3, theUGC Regulations On Curbing The Menace Of Ragging In Higher Educational Institutions, 2009.))\n\nPsychological Harm\n\nCausing psychological harm to a student is considered to be ragging under the law. This may include:\n\n- Any written, verbal or behavioural actions by a student including teasing a student, speaking rudely, etc. For example, calling a student derogatory names.\n- Rowdy or undisciplined behaviour which may annoy the student, cause hardship or psychological harm to any student. For example, stealing and throwing away the notebooks that belong to a student or threatening a student constantly.\n- Asking a student to do an act which he would not ordinarily do. Such incidents may cause a sense of shame, torment or embarrassment to the student thereby affecting his psychological wellbeing. For example, making a student dance in front of the class.\n- Any act that affects the mental health and self-confidence of any student. For example, making a student dance in front of the class and ridiculing him for it.\n- An act or abuse, whether written, verbal or online (emails, posts, etc.), which would result in making a student uncomfortable. For example, spreading rumours on online platforms about a student or ragging for the sake of deriving pleasure out of it.\n\nDisturbing Academic Activity\n\nRagging can take the form of disturbing a student’s academics. If any student prevents, disrupts or disturbs the regular academic activity of  another student, it is ragging. For example, a senior student harassing a junior student into not attending classes.\n\nUsing or Exploiting a Student\n\nRagging can take the form of exploitation of another student. This includes:\n\n- Exploiting the services of any student for completing the academic tasks assigned to an individual/group. For example, making a student do some other student’s homework assignments.\n- Financial extortion or forceful expenditure put on any student.  For example, making a student pay for another student’s expenses.\n\nPhysical Abuse\n\nRagging can take the form of physical abuse and violence. Ragging includes:\n\n- Rowdy behaviour or indiscipline which is likely to cause physical harm  to any student, or any act which makes one fearful/apprehensive of physical harm. For example, threatening to beat up a student.\n- Asking a student to do an act which he would not ordinarily do, and which causes him a sense of shame, torment or embarrassment so as to adversely affect his physical well-being. For example, beating up a student because he did not comply with the orders of a senior to perform a task.\n- Sexual abuse, including assaults, stripping, forcing obscene and lewd acts or gestures, etc. For example, asking a female student to strip.\n- Any act which causes bodily harm or any other danger to a student. For example, mixing laxatives in a student’s food.\n\nDiscriminating against Another Student\n\nRagging can take the form of discrimination and prejudice against another student. Any abuse based on the colour of your skin, race, religion, caste, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, nationality, regional origins, linguistic identity, place of birth, place of residence or economic background, is considered as ragging. For example, if a student is constantly teased and called names based on her regional origins, or is ridiculed because she belongs to a lower socioeconomic status than other students, it can be considered as ragging.\n\nThe intent behind ragging does not matter. For example, to derive pleasure, for fun, to show off authority or superiority – the very act of ragging is a crime under Indian law.\n\nIf you are being ragged, you cancomplainto college authorities or the police.",

However,a persondoes not haveto go through any surgeries to be given recognition with their self-identified gender.1. In this regard, given below are two of the most common forms of surgeries performed:\n\n- Gender Affirmative Therapy (GAT)is a set of procedures, from psychological counselling to sex reassignment surgeries, which aim to change a persons appearance so that it will conform more strongly with the self-identified gender.  For example, Rita was identified to be female at birth, but while growing up, identifies herself as male, and may undergo GAT to masculinize her appearance through breast removal surgery, etc.\n\nThe Supreme Court1has held that it is a constitutional right for a person to be affirmed as male or female after the respective GAT, and that there is no impediment, legal or otherwise, in undergoing GAT.\n\n- Corrective surgery/intersex surgeryrefers to procedures done to modify sex characteristics and genitals when they are anomalous, meaning when there is no clear distinction between male and female genitals.  For example, a child, Nakul, is born with both male and female genitalia, and decides that he self-identifies and feels that his gender is male, and thus, undergoes corrective surgery to align more strongly to the male gender.\n\nThough nation-wide regulations do not exist, some states, like Tamil Nadu, have banned unnecessary medical procedures on infants, to prevent illegal corrective surgery at a young age2.\n\nIn India, there are no guidelines for eligibility, procedure, etc. or laws on GAT or Corrective Surgery.\n\nIf a person faces any discrimination while accessing medical or psychological healthcare, they can take action to alleviate the problem.

Given below are some of the important roles played by the Court:\n\n\n\nAdoption Order (Non-Religious Law)((Sections 12 and 17, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.))\n\nUnder the non-religious law on adoption,((Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.)) the Court receives the application from the SAA (Specialized Adoption Agency) with the relevantdocumentsof the child so that the Court can assess whether an adoption order can be granted. The application would include:\n\n- Details of the SAA and co-applicants (if there are any) like Child Care Institutions\n- Details of the prospective adoptive parent(s) such as name, child adoption resource information and guidance system registration number\n- Details of the child that is going to be adopted\n- The fact that the child has beendeclared legally free for adoption\n- The fact that the adoptive parents have signed a Pre-adoption foster care affidavit allowing social workers of the SAA, DCPU (District Child Protection Unit) to make home visits\n- Copy of the decision of the Adoption Committee\n\nRead aformatof the application here to understand what other details are included in the application. By passing this adoption order, the Court would be granting permission to the parents to be the adoptive parents of the child. Before passing the adoption order, the Court has a duty to keep in mind:((Section 61, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.))\n\n- That the adoption is for the welfare of the child\n- That the wishes of the child are taken into consideration, based on age and understanding of the situation\n- That the adoptive parents have not agreed to or received any payment or reward for the adoption\n- That the adoption proceedings in Court  should be in – camera proceedings.\n\n\n\nPermission to Adopt (Hindu Law)\n\nUnder the Hindu law on adoption,((Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956.)) the guardian requires the Court’s permission to adopt a child, or give him up for adoption, in the following cases:((Section 9(4), Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956.))\n\n- where both the father and mother are dead;\n- where both the father and mother have completely and finally renounced the world;\n- where both the father and mother have abandoned the child;\n- where both the father and mother have been declared to be of unsound mind by the court concerned;\n- where the parentage of the child is not known.\n\n\n\nAppeal (Non-Religious Law and Hindu Law)\n\nUnder the non-religious law on adoption, if you are not satisfied by the orders given by the relevant authorities while adopting a child or if you adoption application has been rejected, you may appeal to the Children’s Court, within 30 days of the relevant order.((Section 101(1), Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.)) However, even if more than 30 days have passed, you can attempt to appeal, and it will be entertained if the Court believes you have sufficient reason for not being able to appeal within the stipulated 30 days. If you are not satisfied with the order given by the Court, you may file an appeal to the High Court of your state.((Section 101(5), Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.))",

Surrendering means you give up your child for physical, emotional or social factors beyond your control.

            "content": "While anything that lowers the authority of the courts can be considered as contempt, there are certain exceptions given in the law.\n\nUnder the law, if a publication, like a book or an article, tends to prejudice any pending court proceeding, such as publicly discussing unsubstantiated evidence, it will amount to criminal contempt.((Rachapudi Subba Rao v Advocate General, Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1981 SC 755; Read with Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Sections 2(c) (ii) & (iii)))However, the law itself gives certain exceptions where a publication will not amount to contempt on the grounds of prejudicing a pending proceeding. They are:\n\n- If at the time of publication, the publisher had no reason to believe that such a case was pending.((Section 3(1), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n- If no court proceeding was pending at the time of publication.((Section 3(2), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n- If the person is in charge of distributing something that may be seen as contempt and they did not know that it contained anything that would be prejudicial to an ongoing court proceeding.((Section 3(3), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n- However, this defence of ‘innocent distribution’ is not available for the press as the law gives certain criteria to be met for publishing books,((Section 3, Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867.))papers,((Section 3, Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867.))and newspapers((Section 5, Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867.)). A person found distributing books, papers, or newspapers that have not met these criteria, will be guilty of contempt.((Proviso to Section 3(3), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n\nIn India, trials and other judicial proceedings are generally held in open court and are subject to public scrutiny. This is required for a healthy, objective, and fair administration of justice.((Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar v State of Maharashtra, AIR 1967 SC 1.))This system relies on numerous reporters that accurately report the daily proceedings in a court. The law protects such legal reporting, provided that it is fair and accurate.((Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Section 4.))\n\nThe terms ‘fair and accurate, does not mean that the report should be a word-to-word reproduction of the proceedings. Rather, it should relay what has happened in the court,((Borrie & Lowe, The Law of Contempt, LexisNexis Butterworths, 3rd Edn, p 270.))and should not misrepresent the court proceedings before the public.((Roach v. Garvan, (1742) 2 Atk 469.))Unfair reporting that misleads the readers, is not protected by the law and would amount to contempt.((E.T. Sen v E. Narayanan, AIR 1969 Del 201, at 213.))For example, reporting or quoting an incorrect statement which was not made by a judge on social media.\n\n\n\nIn situations of in-camera trials, which take place in a closed room inside a court, certain forms of reporting may amount to contempt. Some examples of in-camera trials are cases of rape,((Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Section 327(2)))matrimonial disputes,((Special Marriage Act, 1954, Section 33 for example.))etc, In such in-camera proceedings, the reporting of the proceedings, even if they are fair and accurate, will amount to contempt if:\n\n- Such publication is contrary to or against any existing law.((Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Section 7(1)(a).))For example, reporting of the proceedings inrapetrials or child sexual abusetrialsare prohibited by law, and a person has to obtain the permission of the court in case they want to still report such matters.((Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Section 327(3).))\n- The court has explicitly prohibited such reporting.((Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Section 7(1)(b).))For example, in the evidence stage of a case involving national security or terrorism.\n- The court is conducting in-camera proceedings for reasons connected with public order or security of the State.((Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Section 7(1)(c).))\n- The information published relates to a secret process, discovery or invention which is an issue in proceedings. For example, in patent objection matters.((Section 7(1)(d), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n\nIf a case has been finally heard and decided by the court, a person will be allowed to publish fair comments on the merits of that particular case.((Section 5, Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))Comments about the judgment itself, and other comments about the merits of the case, are an exception to contempt of court.((Samaraditya Pal, The Law of Contempt-Contempt of Courts and Legislatures, Chapter 5, Defenses, Punishments, Procedures, Limitation and Conferment of Rule Making Power (5th edn, 2012).))Since judgments are public documents, and the public acts of a Judge are subject to public scrutiny , no one can prohibit fair comments on either of them.((Rama Dayal Markarha v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1978 SC 921, at 927.))However, the exact test for ‘fair comment’ is unclear and will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, misquoting the judge or making false statements about judges would not amount to ‘fair comment’. Additionally, such comments have to be made without any bad intentions, and without the motive to bring down the image of the judiciary or impair the administration of justice itself.((In re: Ajay Kumar Pandey, (1998) 7 SCC 248.))\n\nIf a person has made a complaint against a presiding officer of a Subordinate Court, to either the High Court or another Subordinate Court, such a complaint will not amount to contempt. However, such a complaint has to be made in good faith.((Section 6, Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))For example, if a person files a complaint against a District Judge because of a legitimate grievance.\n\nSaying or publishing the truth for the public good may be treated by the court as an exception to contempt.((Section 13(b), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))This is similar to the defence oftruthin defamation, but the court has the option to decide whether or not to accept such a remark.",

            "content": "[Trigger Warning:The following content contains information on physical violence which some readers may find disturbing.]\n\nSurvivors of acid attacks have the following rights under the law:\n\n\n\nRight to Seek Medical Treatment\n\nA survivor of an acid attack has the right to seekmedical treatmentin both government and private hospitals. The Supreme Court issued guidelines for acid attack crimes where they said that:\n\n- No hospital or clinic can refuse to treat acid attack survivors citing the lack of specialized facilities.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n- Government and private hospitals have to provide survivors with first-aid and medical treatment free of cost.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nThe court has placed the responsibility for the treatment and rehabilitation of survivors on the state government.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [29].)) Additionally, it has expected states and union territories to take action against hospitals that refuse to treat acid attack survivors.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nRight to File a Complaint\n\nAcid attack survivors also have the right tofile a complaintagainst the perpetrator. The complaint can also be filed by the survivor’s relative, friend or acquaintance, any person who has witnessed the crime, or any person who comes to know of the crime. To see a list of other persons who can file the complaint, seehere.\n\nRight to Compensation\n\nAcid attack survivors have the right to seekcompensationfrom the state government. The Victims Compensation Scheme(( Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes 2018, National Legal Services Authority, accessed athttps://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/Final%20VC%20Sheme_0.pdf.)) that was drafted by the National Legal Services Authority, was approved by the Supreme Court in 2018. It provides for mandatory compensation for survivors of acid attacks as well as sexual crimes including sexual assault, murder, kidnapping etc. Apart from compensation under this scheme, the survivor receives the fine amount that the perpetrator pays for committing the crime which is charged by the Court.(( Section 357B, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.))\n\nVarious state governments have formed Victim Compensation Schemes for acid attack survivors. Keeping in mind that there is a lack of uniformity in the state schemes, and the amount of compensation specified in most of these schemes is too low, the Supreme Court stated that:\n\n- The minimum amount of Rupees 3 lakh must be provided by the state government to every survivor.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [13], [14].)) This is the minimum amount, and the state government can provide a higher amount, where necessary.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- Any compensation amount must factor in not only the survivor’s physical injuries but also their inability to lead a full life.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- The Chief Secretary/ Administrator of the state/UT concerned must ensure that this amount is paid.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [14].))\n\nTo learn more on information on schemes in different states for survivors of violence, contact details of one-stop centres, protection officers and helpline numbers, check out the Nyaaya Map on Key Information for Survivors of Violence.\n\nGiven below are the list of State Victim CompensationSchemesin India:",

            "content": "Both in urban and rural areas, if the officers of the Municipality or the Panchayat believe that manual scavenging may be taking place in their area of control, they have to do a survey and create a list of manual scavengers. The Municipality and the Panchayat have a duty to rehabilitate the people included in this list. The District Magistrate is responsible for rehabilitating manual scavengers in that district in accordance with this law. The District Magistrate or the State Government may assign responsibilities to subordinate officers and officers in the Municipality. The process for rehabilitation is as follows:\n\n- Immediate help – Give them a photo ID and some cash within 1 month.\n- Children’s education – Their children can get a government scholarship.\n- Property – The government must put in place schemes under which the person is allotted land and money to build a house or money for a built house.\n- Training for other jobs – The government has to help train either the person or another adult member of their family in other skills. The person should also be paid Rs. 3000 during the time they are undergoing training.\n- Loan – The government must put in place schemes under which the person (or another adult family member) has the option of getting a subsidy or loan with lower interest rates to help them get into another field or occupation.\n- Other Help – The government can choose to give them any other kind of legal or other help.\n- Government Schemes – The Central Government has put in place a scheme called the ‘Self Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation’ of Manual Scavengers.

            "content": "The following Covid-19 tests are done in India1:\n\nRapid Antigen Test (RAT):\n\nAn antigen refers to any foreign matter or viral proteins in the body that triggers an immune response. This test helps identify the antigens related to the Covid-19 virus. Antigen test, also known asrapid antigen test,is a rapid diagnostic test, but these tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection.\n\nRT-PCR:\n\nRT-PCR is a method of testing that is used to directly detect the presence of the virus in the sample. The test detects the RNA(Ribonucleic acid) of the virus which is the genetic material of the virus.\n\nTrueNat\n\nTrueNat is a chip-based, portable RT-PCR machine, originally developed as a portable diagnostic tool for tuberculosis. The latest versions of the TrueNat machine can detect an enzyme (called RdRp) found in the RNA of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAntibody test\n\nAn antibody test,also known as Serology test, is a screening test for Covid-19 antibodies in the blood. It tells if someone was previously infected with the virus that causes Covid-19. The antibody test does not look for the active virus but checks whether the immune system has responded to the infection.\n\nThe Government  has arranged for  free Covid-19 testing  at approved laboratories across India. Although the test is not free in private labs and hospitals, the Supreme Court(( Shashank Deo Sudhi v. Union of India, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 358)).has stated that free testing should be done for the poor who are eligible under theAyushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana.Beneficiaries of this scheme will be able to  access  free testing in private labs and access to Covid-19 treatment at government empanelled hospitals.\n\nTo get tested  free of cost, a person can go to any government hospital. Calling thehelpline numbersbefore getting a test done will enable a person to get updated information. Please seeherefor the list of government and  private clinics for testing of Covid-19, as released by Indian Council of Medical Research.",

            "content": "Public utility services are facilities provided by the Government, which are essential to a citizen’s needs. For instance, these services include, the supply of water to homes, supply of electricity, the postal system, the banking system, railways, etc. The consumer protection law enables consumers to file complaints about these public utility services.\n\nSome examples of public utility services include(( Section 22A(b), Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.)):\n\n- Transport service for carrying passengers or goods by air, road or water\n- Postal services\n- Telephone services\n- Power facilities\n- Lighting facilities\n- Water facilities\n- Insurance service\n\nThe law recognizes public utility services as “establishments” under the law. This means that the local branch offices of a public utility service which are establishments, can be held liable in the same way as its main central authority. For example, if one has a complaint against the local water department, one can file a complaint against the local/district department itself, and not against theCentral Water Commission. Other than the mainstream consumer protection laws in India, Permanent Lok Adalats can also be approached to request for good standards of public utility services at a district level(( Section 22B, Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.)).\n\nIf someone is obstructing, stopping or not providing you with a public utility service, you can file a complaint with theNational Government Services Portal. The Portal, though not exclusively dedicated to consumer services, has a wide range of public services against which consumers can file grievances. Issues such as commodity rates (prices of gold, silver etc.), monitoring ration cards, etc. can easily be done by visiting theNational Government Services Portal.  Among other things, the portal provides a user with information on the consumer complaint forum, state- wise break up on details of the Public Distribution System etc. Even complaints about the Bureau of Indian Standards can be filedhere. This means that consumers can file a complaint about the quality of a BIS-certified product, Hallmarked products, misleading advertisements about the BIS standard, etc.(( Consumer Protection, Bureau of Indian Standards, accessed at https://bis.gov.in/other/consumer_affairs.htm#:~:text=%2D%20Through%20Online%20Complaint%20Registration%20on,Head%20(Consumer%20Affairs%20Department).))\n\nThe Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances’ (CPGRAMS)portalis very useful to file complaints about  postal services, telecommunication, banking services, insurance services, school and education, road transport, natural gas, etc.\n\n- Thepostal departmentdeals with issues such as delay, non-delivery, pensions, insurance (postal service),corruptioncharges, e-commerce related problems, AADHAR related issues, etc.\n- Thetelecom departmentdeals with issues related to mobile, broadband, landline, pension, employee, malpractices and corruption. Complaints about telecom facilities can be filed at thetelecom grievance portal.\n- Thebanking and insurance divisiondeals with issues related to bank lockers, deficiency in customer service, education and housing loans, NBFCs, Pradhan Mantri schemes, fraud, mobile banking, misappropriation, harassment, loan settlement, etc. Complaints about banking facilities can be filed at theRBI complaints portal. Complaints can also be filed to theBanking Ombudsmen, who are senior officials appointed by the RBI to redress customer complaints against deficiency in certain banking services.\n\nSome states such as Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh have implemented electricity callservicesfor making complaints about electricity service. For complaints related to water services, customers can lodge  grievances  at theMinistry of Drinking Water and Sanitation grievance portal.\n\nThe issues listed above are only indications of the kinds of complaints that can be made, and it is not an exhaustive list.",

It does not matter whether or not the employer has any allocable surplus during the previous accounting year(( Section 26, Code on Wages, 2019)).\n\nIf the allocable surplus is more than the amount of minimum bonus payable to employees, the employer must pay every employee a bonus proportionate to their wages for that accounting year (not more than twenty percent of their wages).

The Income Tax Act does not differentiate between a commercial and residential property. All types of properties are taxed under the head ‘income from house property’ in the income tax return. This includes property you own. Income from house property is taxable if:(( Section 22, Income Tax Act, 1961))\n\n- The house property should consist of any building or land attached with it\n- The taxpayer should be the owner of the property\n- Business or profession is not carried on by the taxpayer in the house property\n\nRemuneration, bonus or commission received by a partner from the firm or anyone working independently in a business or profession, is not taxable as ‘Income from Salaries’.

            "content": "Every person has a right to file the following types of consumercomplaintsunder consumer protection law:\n\n“E-commerce” means buying or selling goods or services (including digital products) over digital or electronic networks(( Section 2(16), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). It includes the production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery of goods and services byelectronic means(( Electronic Commerce, WTO, accessed at https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/mc11_e/briefing_notes_e/bfecom_e.htm#:~:text=Electronic%20commerce%2C%20or%20e%2Dcommerce,and%20services%20by%20electronic%20means%22.&text=These%20WTO%20bodies%20were%20instructed,WTO%20agreements%20and%20e%2Dcommerce.)).\n\nE-commerce entities, such as online shopping websites like Flipkart(( Ajay Kumar v. Flipkart Internet Private Limited, 2018 SCC OnLine NCDRC 549.))and Amazon(( Kent RO Systems v. Amazon Seller Services, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 8016.)), have long been treated as service providers who work for a profit(( Rediff.Com India Limited v. Ms. Urmil Munjal, 2013(2) C.P.C. 536.)). They have been held liable whenever there has been a violation of consumer rights. One of the major reforms brought about by the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 is that it lays down a set of rules to govern these e-commerce entities(( Consumer Protection (E-Commerce Rules), 2020.)):\n\n- E-commerce entities will have to respond within 48 hours of complaint.\n- Complaints can be made from any place, regardless of where the purchase was made.\n- E-commerce entities such as Amazon, Flipkart, are now required to display the details of the sellers, such as their legal name, geographic address, contact details, etc.\n- These entities must not directly or indirectly manipulate the goods’ prices, and must not adopt any unfair or deceptive methods of sale.\n- They are prohibited from exaggerating the qualities of a product, and posting fake reviews.\n- The law mandates the protection of consumers’ personal information so that personal details are kept confidential and the privacy of consumers is protected.\n\nAn advertisement is a promotion through television, radio, or any other electronic media, newspapers, banners, posters, handbills, wall-writing etc. A misleading advertisement says untrue things about the goods and services, which can mislead the consumer in  buying them(( Misleading Advertisements, Department of Consumer Affairs, accessed at https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/more/misleading-advertisements. These advertisements may make false claims about a product or services’ usefulness((Section 2(47)(f), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)), quality and quantity(( Section 2(28)(ii), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)), or deliberately conceal important information about the product(( Section 2(28)(iv), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))(such as known side-effects), etc. Advertisers can be sued for making misleading claims in their advertisements. These include claims of being the first toothpaste to have a certain beneficial composition when it actually isn’t(( Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. v. Anchor Health & Beauty Care P. Ltd., (2008) 7 MLJ 1119.)), or advertising schemes that seek to increase profits without passing on the benefit to the consumers(( Society of Catalysts v. Vodafone Essar Mobile Services Limited, LNIND 2008 SCDRCD 962.)), etc.\n\nUnfair trade practices have a broad definition under the consumer protection law. They include false statements about the goods’ standard, quality and quantity, and the marketing of used/second-hand goods as new goods. It also includes false claims about a warranty, or the warranty period being scientifically untested, etc. This has resulted in several lawsuits, one involving a noodle-maker labelling its packets with false lead content(( M/S Nestle India Limited v. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, W.P. L. No. 1688 of 2015.)), replacing the labels of pharmaceutical drugs to extend the expiry period(( Pooja Roy v. Krishnango Bhattacharya, C.R.R 2796 of 2008, Calcutta H.C.)), marketing adulterated goods with different ingredients than stated on the label(( Consumer Guidance Society v. Amway India Enterprises, (2007) C.C 140 of 2007.)), etc.\n\nRestrictive trade practice means a trade practice which tends to manipulate the price, or delivery, of goods, which affect the flow of supplies in the market. This leads to the consumers facing unfair costs or restrictions. This is usually done in some of the following ways: price fixing, dealing exclusively, restricting the resale values of sold goods, mandating that buying one good or service entails buying other goods or services. One real-life example of this is the inbuilt price of delivery and fixing electronic goods. This ensures that the consumer ends up paying for the service, whether they want to or not, making them bear unfair costs.\n\nDefective goods are goods(( Sections 2(10) and 2(11), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.))with any fault, imperfection or shortcoming in the quality, quantity, purity or standard which is required to be maintained by the seller, under the law in force. Some examples are adulterated or imperfectly brewed beverages, malfunctioning machinery, misshapen artifacts, etc.\n\nSpurious goods are those which are falsely claimed to be genuine(( Section 2(43), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))or are fake or imitative of real, original goods. These are often of inferior quality and infringe upon the trademarks and copyrights of legal owners of the original goods. A crucial example is that of medicines or cheap make-up products found in local markets. Often, spurious medicines are marketed under another drug’s name, or imitate/substitute another drug in a deceptive way(( Drugs and Cosmetics FAQs, Integrated Grievance Redressal Mechanism, accessed at https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/faq-details.php?fid=Drugs%20and%20Cosmetics.)).\n\nOvercharging generally occurs in covert ways, when sellers charge the consumer more than what is prescribed as the Maximum Retail Price of a product. It is a gross violation of consumer rights.\n\nPresently, the law also addresses grievances related to food products. For example, customers can file their grievances about packaged food like the presence of adulterant, expired goods, missing FSSAI license, etc. or serving issues like the lack of hygiene, presence of pests, etc. at the Food Safety ConnectPortal.\n\n",

The Supreme Court issued guidelines for acid attack crimes where they said that:\n\n- No hospital or clinic can refuse to treat acid attack survivors citing the lack of specialized facilities.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n- Government and private hospitals have to provide survivors with first-aid and medical treatment free of cost.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nThe court has placed the responsibility for the treatment and rehabilitation of survivors on the state government.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [29].)) Additionally, it has expected states and union territories to take action against hospitals that refuse to treat acid attack survivors.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nRight to File a Complaint\n\nAcid attack survivors also have the right tofile a complaintagainst the perpetrator. The complaint can also be filed by the survivor’s relative, friend or acquaintance, any person who has witnessed the crime, or any person who comes to know of the crime. To see a list of other persons who can file the complaint, seehere.\n\nRight to Compensation\n\nAcid attack survivors have the right to seekcompensationfrom the state government. The Victims Compensation Scheme(( Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes 2018, National Legal Services Authority, accessed athttps://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/Final%20VC%20Sheme_0.pdf.)) that was drafted by the National Legal Services Authority, was approved by the Supreme Court in 2018. It provides for mandatory compensation for survivors of acid attacks as well as sexual crimes including sexual assault, murder, kidnapping etc. Apart from compensation under this scheme, the survivor receives the fine amount that the perpetrator pays for committing the crime which is charged by the Court.(( Section 357B, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.))\n\nVarious state governments have formed Victim Compensation Schemes for acid attack survivors. Keeping in mind that there is a lack of uniformity in the state schemes, and the amount of compensation specified in most of these schemes is too low, the Supreme Court stated that:\n\n- The minimum amount of Rupees 3 lakh must be provided by the state government to every survivor.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [13], [14].)) This is the minimum amount, and the state government can provide a higher amount, where necessary.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- Any compensation amount must factor in not only the survivor’s physical injuries but also their inability to lead a full life.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- The Chief Secretary/ Administrator of the state/UT concerned must ensure that this amount is paid.(( Laxmi v.

If anyone obstructs their entry, they can even break open the door or remove any obstacle in their way.\n\nSearching a person\n\nIf an authorised police officer wants to search you, you can ask the search to be conducted in the presence of a magistrate or certain gazetted officers. Once you make this request, you can be detained by the police officer till you can be brought before a magistrate or an appropriate gazetted officer. However, if the police officer believes that it is not possible to wait for a gazetted officer or a magistrate, he can proceed with the search.2\n\nPlease note that women can only be searched by a woman officer.\n\nSeizure\n\nIn the process of the search, the police officer also has the power to seize the following:\n\n- Drugs, substances and anything used to manufacture it\n- Any article, vehicle or animal that may have been used in the process\n- Any documents or articles that can be evidence and prove that a crime in relation to drugs was committed\n\nArrest\n\nWhile carrying out the search and seizure, if the police officer believes that a crime has been committed in relation to drugs or narcotics, he can even arrest the suspected person.

To know more about these rights, please readhere.\n\nImmediate Cases – No Warrant Needed\n\nWhile ideally this search and seizure has to be done in the day time, i.e. between sunrise and sunset and with a warrant from an appropriate judge, if the police officer believes that in the time taken to obtain the warrant the necessary evidence could be concealed or the suspect may escape, he can carry out the search and seizure without a warrant.

This FIR can either be filed by the survivor, their family members, any person who has witnessed the crime, or any person who comes to know of the crime.\n\nSince acid attack and throwing/ attempting to throw acid are cognizable offences under S. 326A and 326B respectively of the IPC, the police may arrest the accused without a warrant, where the police are of the opinion that the person is dangerous to be allowed to remain free. The person filing an FIR also has the right to get a free copy of the FIR.\n\nStep 2: Police Investigation Starts\n\nAfter the filing of the FIR, the police will investigate the complaint and submit a final report based on the investigation and witness statements. This investigation should be completed within a time span of 60 to 90 days, when the accused is in custody.(( Section 167, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.))\n\nStep 3: Filing Charge Sheet and Trial Begins\n\nUpon investigation, if the police are of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence of the crime being committed by the accused, they can file a charge sheet with a competent criminal court, requesting it to take notice of the case. This commences the trial process. If there is inadequate evidence, a closure report can be filed with the Magistrate to close the case. However, this may be challenged. Please take the help of a lawyer in the relevant district court for the trial process.",

It is to make sure that the person does not run away. The amount might be less or more, depending upon the nature of the crime. In case you don’t have money, your property can be attached to get bail. This deposit of money or attachment of property is mandatory for bail. The Court may ask the person to not leave the territory of the country and report to the court whenever he is required to do so under the Bond.\n\n\n\n- Personal Bond\n\nIn certain cases, while granting a person bail, the Court may not ask them to submit a bail bond, but instead release them on their own promise, or what is commonly known as a personal bond. Bail can be granted on a personal bond either with or without sureties. Courts have discretion in the matter so they may release the accused by taking only a personal bond without insisting for a surety.\n\n\n\n- Surety\n\nWhen you approach the court for bail, sometimes the court wants sufficient guarantees to ensure you won’t run away. The court may ask you to get some people to take this responsibility. The same person does not have to always remain a surety. A person acting as a surety can apply to be ‘discharged’ from their position of a surety.  In such a circumstance, you will need to replace the surety. You will need to get another person to the Court to sign as your new surety. If you can’t replace the surety, you will be taken into custody.",

You can compound the offence committed if you are one of the two categories of persons:\n\n- Someone who commits an offence for the first time.\n- A parent or a guardian who commits an offence by not complying with the child labour provisions and law.\n\nTo compound an offence, follow these steps:\n\nIf you fail to pay the amount, then the proceedings of the case will be continued in accordance with the child labour laws that is, you can be tried and punished, but if you do pay the amount, then you cannot be taken to court for the offence since you have already paid and settled it.",

These crimes are usually of serious nature such as rape, murder, assault etc\n\nIf any of these scenarios apply to you, then the police do not need the warrant to arrest you:\n\n- When you commit a crime in front of a police officer (for example at a public event or in a police station);\n- When the police have received reliable information or a complaint that you have committed a cognizable crime;\n- If the court has declared you as aproclaimed offender;\n- If the police found you with stolen property and they suspect that you stole it;\n- If you cause trouble to a police officer who is performing his duty;\n- If you escape from custody of the police or jail;\n- If you are suspected of deserting the army;\n- If you are a suspect in a crime outside India and you are liable to be brought back to India; or\n- If you were convicted of a crime in the past and have violated the conditions of your release.\n\nThe possibility of being arrested is much lesser if you have been accused of a cognizable crime with a jail time of fewer than seven years. The police should have reliable information which points to your involvement. Further, you can be arrested only if:\n\n- you are likely to escape, destroy evidence, or influence the victim or witnesses,\n- you are likely to commit yet another crime, or\n- if your presence is necessary for police investigation.",

The Supreme Court issued guidelines for acid attack crimes where they said that:\n\n- No hospital or clinic can refuse to treat acid attack survivors citing the lack of specialized facilities.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n- Government and private hospitals have to provide survivors with first-aid and medical treatment free of cost.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nThe court has placed the responsibility for the treatment and rehabilitation of survivors on the state government.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [29].)) Additionally, it has expected states and union territories to take action against hospitals that refuse to treat acid attack survivors.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2016) 3 SCC 669, order dated 10/4/2015 [34], [35].))\n\nRight to File a Complaint\n\nAcid attack survivors also have the right tofile a complaintagainst the perpetrator.

To see a list of other persons who can file the complaint, seehere.\n\nRight to Compensation\n\nAcid attack survivors have the right to seekcompensationfrom the state government. The Victims Compensation Scheme(( Compensation Scheme for Women Victims/Survivors of Sexual Assault/other Crimes 2018, National Legal Services Authority, accessed athttps://wcd.nic.in/sites/default/files/Final%20VC%20Sheme_0.pdf.)) that was drafted by the National Legal Services Authority, was approved by the Supreme Court in 2018. It provides for mandatory compensation for survivors of acid attacks as well as sexual crimes including sexual assault, murder, kidnapping etc. Apart from compensation under this scheme, the survivor receives the fine amount that the perpetrator pays for committing the crime which is charged by the Court.(( Section 357B, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.))\n\nVarious state governments have formed Victim Compensation Schemes for acid attack survivors. Keeping in mind that there is a lack of uniformity in the state schemes, and the amount of compensation specified in most of these schemes is too low, the Supreme Court stated that:\n\n- The minimum amount of Rupees 3 lakh must be provided by the state government to every survivor.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [13], [14].)) This is the minimum amount, and the state government can provide a higher amount, where necessary.(( Parivartan Kendra v. Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [20], [21].))\n- Any compensation amount must factor in not only the survivor’s physical injuries but also their inability to lead a full life.(( Parivartan Kendra v.

Also, if they think that there are no sufficient grounds to investigate further, they may not do so.\n\nWhen the Police are done with their investigation and have found enough evidence to proceed with a criminal case, they file a charge sheet. However, after investigation, if they have not found anything proving the commission of a crime, they will suggest closing the case by filing a closure report to the Magistrate.\n\nIt is the filing of the charge sheet where the trial of a criminal case begins. The police do not have a time limit to file the charge sheet or a closure report. Even the Magistrate cannot compel the police to file the charge sheet in a particular period of time. But if the person accused of a crime is in jail, then they have either 60 days (where the punishment for the crime is less than 10 years) or 90 days (where the punishment of the crime is more than 10 years) to file the charge sheet.\n\n",

Both will be stamped and one will be returned to you. The stamp bears a Daily Diary Number or DD No. and is proof that they received your complaint.\n\n\n\n- Once the police have read it out, if all the details are correct, you can sign the FIR. You have the right to get a copy of the FIR for free. Note the FIR number, date of FIR and the name of the police station. In case you lose your copy, you can use these details to access the FIR online for free.\n\n\n\nAfter registering the FIR, the contents of the FIR cannot be changed.

            "content": "Bail is when an accused assures the police that he will not run away or commit any more crimes if he is released into society. Thus, bail is usually through a :\n\n\n\n- Bail Bond\n\nA bail bond is the money that a person must deposit with the court when they have been granted bail. It is to make sure that the person does not run away. The amount might be less or more, depending upon the nature of the crime. In case you don’t have money, your property can be attached to get bail. This deposit of money or attachment of property is mandatory for bail. The Court may ask the person to not leave the territory of the country and report to the court whenever he is required to do so under the Bond.\n\n\n\n- Personal Bond\n\nIn certain cases, while granting a person bail, the Court may not ask them to submit a bail bond, but instead release them on their own promise, or what is commonly known as a personal bond. Bail can be granted on a personal bond either with or without sureties. Courts have discretion in the matter so they may release the accused by taking only a personal bond without insisting for a surety.\n\n\n\n- Surety\n\nWhen you approach the court for bail, sometimes the court wants sufficient guarantees to ensure you won’t run away. The court may ask you to get some people to take this responsibility. The same person does not have to always remain a surety. A person acting as a surety can apply to be ‘discharged’ from their position of a surety.  In such a circumstance, you will need to replace the surety. You will need to get another person to the Court to sign as your new surety. If you can’t replace the surety, you will be taken into custody.",

It’s against the law to intentionally harm someone’s reputation, cause them to be hated or disgraced through text, image, cartoons, caricatures or effigies.\n\nThere can be two forms of defamation – slander and libel.\n\nSlander involves something that is spoken, with the intention to harm someone’s reputation, and which can be heard. It is in verbal form. For example, Rahul says bad things about Seema’s character, which results in Seema losing her job. Rahul has committed thecrimeof defamation through slander.\n\nLibel involves something that is visually represented, with the intention to harm someone’s reputation, and which can be seen. So, anything that can be written, printed or something on an effigy, movie or statue can be libel. If Rahul writes something about Seema in a magazine in a derogatory manner, then Rahul has committed thecrimeof defamation through libel.",

However, if the identity of the patient is not clear from such publication, the consent of the patient is not required.5\n\nIdentities of deceased children and child victims of sexual offences are private and confidential.

It must also ensure that the child is sent to a Place of Safety if they are detained during proceedings. If the child is found guilty of having committed a Heinous Offence, they will be sent to the Place of Safety until they are 21 years old, after which they can be sent to jail.
