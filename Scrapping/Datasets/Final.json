It is to make sure that the person does not run away. The amount might be less or more, depending upon the nature of the crime. In case you don\u2019t have money, your property can be attached to get bail. This deposit of money or attachment of property is mandatory for bail. The Court may ask the person to not leave the territory of the country and report to the court whenever he is required to do so under the Bond.\n\n\n\n- Personal Bond\n\nIn certain cases, while granting a person bail, the Court may not ask them to submit a bail bond, but instead release them on their own promise, or what is commonly known as a personal bond. Bail can be granted on a personal bond either with or without sureties. Courts have discretion in the matter so they may release the accused by taking only a personal bond without insisting for a surety.\n\n\n\n- Surety\n\nWhen you approach the court for bail, sometimes the court wants sufficient guarantees to ensure you won\u2019t run away.

A person acting as a surety can apply to be \u2018discharged\u2019 from their position of a surety.\u00a0 In such a circumstance, you will need to replace the surety.

It is mandatory for the police to record the information provided, and then transfer it to the police station in whose area/jurisdictionthe offence took place. For instance, if a crime was committed in North Delhi, the information can even be registered with a police station in South Delhi.\n\nThe law deals with four categories of sexual harassment(( Section 354A, Indian Penal Code, 1860.)):\n\n- Physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures (Inappropriate sexual touch)\n- A demand or request forsexual favours\n- Making sexualremarks and threats\n- Showing pornography\n\nThe punishment for inappropriately touching, demanding or requesting sexual favours and making sexual coloured remarks is jail time up to three years with a fine. For showing pornography, the jail time is up to one year along with a fine.1\n\nA survivor can go to the police and file anFIRafter which the police will investigate and file charges before the court.

This FIR can either be filed by the survivor, their family members, any person who has witnessed the crime, or any person who comes to know of the crime.\n\nSince acid attack and throwing/ attempting to throw acid are cognizable offences under S. 326A and 326B respectively of the IPC, the police may arrest the accused without a warrant, where the police are of the opinion that the person is dangerous to be allowed to remain free. The person filing an FIR also has the right to get a free copy of the FIR.\n\nStep 2: Police Investigation Starts\n\nAfter the filing of the FIR, the police will investigate the complaint and submit a final report based on the investigation and witness statements. This investigation should be completed within a time span of 60 to 90 days, when the accused is in custody.(( Section 167, Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.))\n\nStep 3: Filing Charge Sheet and Trial Begins\n\nUpon investigation, if the police are of the opinion that there is sufficient evidence of the crime being committed by the accused, they can file a charge sheet with a competent criminal court, requesting it to take notice of the case. This commences the trial process. If there is inadequate evidence, a closure report can be filed with the Magistrate to close the case. However, this may be challenged. Please take the help of a lawyer in the relevant district court for the trial process.",

Noise at such levels may beinjuriousto human beings, living creatures, plants, property and the environment2\n\nThe law knownas the Noise Pollution (Regulation And Control) Rules, 2000regulates and controls noise in India.\n\nEveryone has the right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950 to live in peace, comfort and quiet within their house and has a right to prevent the noise from reaching them3. No one can claim a right to create noise even in their own premises which would travel beyond their precincts and cause nuisance to neighbours or others. That\u2019s why any noise which affects the ordinary comforts of life of a person is also considered to be a nuisance4.\n\nThe word noise is not explained in any law but noise is considered to be an environmental pollutant1in India. It is one of the main causes of environmental pollution.\n\nNoise derives its meaning from the Latin term \u2018nausea\u2019. Courts have defined noise as \u2018unwanted sound, a potential hazard to health and communication dumped into the environment with regard to the adverse effect it may have on unwilling ears4. For example, a blaring horn causes unwanted noise but the sound which pleases the listeners is music and is not considered to be noise4.\n\nDecibel is the unit of measurement of noise. There are noise limits that you will have to follow depending on the area you live in. However, since measuring noise requires scientific instruments (such as a sound level meter), you may not always know if you are exceeding the noise limits for a particular area. In such cases, you should:\n\n- Make sure that regardless of what you do or which equipment you use, it does not turn out to benoisy and a disturbance for others.For example, if you are playing music during a party, try to keep the volume down at night time while people are sleeping.\n- Don\u2019t wait for your neighbours or people around you to file a complaint to the police. If they mention that you are making noise that is disturbing them, try toreduce the noise.\n\nPlease note that it does not matter whether you made the noise unintentionally or intentionally; all that matters is whether you have created too much noise.\n\nIf any noise causes you annoyance, discomfort or any injury, then you can file acomplaintwith the police or your State\u2019s Pollution Control Board. Otherwise, you can also complain if you know that the noise5. level is disturbing you or it happensat night between 10:00 pm and 6:00 am.",

Some of the acts considered as ragging are:(( Section 3,\u00a0theUGC Regulations On Curbing The Menace Of Ragging In Higher Educational Institutions, 2009.))\n\nPsychological Harm\n\nCausing psychological harm to a student is considered to be ragging under the law. This may include:\n\n- Any written, verbal or behavioural actions by a student including teasing a student, speaking rudely, etc. For example, calling a student derogatory names.\n- Rowdy or undisciplined behaviour which may annoy the student, cause hardship or psychological harm to any student. For example, stealing and throwing away the notebooks that belong to a student or threatening a student constantly.\n- Asking a student to do an act which he would not ordinarily do. Such incidents may cause a sense of shame, torment or embarrassment to the student thereby affecting his psychological wellbeing. For example, making a student dance in front of the class.\n- Any act that affects the mental health and self-confidence of any student. For example, making a student dance in front of the class and ridiculing him for it.\n- An act or abuse, whether written, verbal or online (emails, posts, etc.), which would result in making a student uncomfortable. For example, spreading rumours on online platforms about a student or ragging for the sake of deriving pleasure out of it.\n\nDisturbing Academic Activity\n\nRagging can take the form of disturbing a student\u2019s academics. If any student prevents, disrupts or disturbs the regular academic activity of\u00a0 another student, it is ragging. For example, a senior student harassing a junior student into not attending classes.\n\nUsing or Exploiting a Student\n\nRagging can take the form of exploitation of another student. This includes:\n\n- Exploiting the services of any student for completing the academic tasks assigned to an individual/group. For example, making a student do some other student\u2019s homework assignments.\n- Financial extortion or forceful expenditure put on any student.\u00a0 For example, making a student pay for another student\u2019s expenses.\n\nPhysical Abuse\n\nRagging can take the form of physical abuse and violence. Ragging includes:\n\n- Rowdy behaviour or indiscipline which is likely to cause physical harm\u00a0 to any student, or any act which makes one fearful/apprehensive of physical harm. For example, threatening to beat up a student.\n- Asking a student to do an act which he would not ordinarily do, and which causes him a sense of shame, torment or embarrassment so as to adversely affect his physical well-being. For example, beating up a student because he did not comply with the orders of a senior to perform a task.\n- Sexual abuse, including assaults, stripping, forcing obscene and lewd acts or gestures, etc. For example, asking a female student to strip.\n- Any act which causes bodily harm or any other danger to a student. For example, mixing laxatives in a student\u2019s food.\n\nDiscriminating against Another Student\n\nRagging can take the form of discrimination and prejudice against another student. Any abuse based on\u00a0the colour of your skin, race, religion, caste, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, appearance, nationality, regional origins, linguistic identity, place of birth, place of residence or economic background, is considered as ragging.\u00a0For example, if a student is constantly teased and called names based on her regional origins, or is ridiculed because she belongs to a lower socioeconomic status than other students, it can be considered as ragging.\n\nThe intent behind ragging does not matter. For example, to derive pleasure, for fun, to show off authority or superiority \u2013 the very act of ragging is a crime under Indian law.\n\nIf you are being ragged, you cancomplainto college authorities or the police.",

For instance, one must have aPAN Cardto be able to file income tax returns or aVoter ID Cardto vote in elections, but the government does not mandatorily require you to possess any of these proofs of identification.\n\nHowever, please note that noproof of identification, such asAadhar,Passport, is a conclusive proof of citizenship in India.\n\nAcquiring Indian Citizenship\n\nUnder the law, you are considered an Indian citizen if you are born in India and fall in one of the 3 categories below:2\n\n- If you were born between 26th January 1950 to 1st July 1987: You are a citizen irrespective of the nationality of your parents.\n- If you were born between 1st July 1987 to 3rd December 2004:\u00a0 One of your parents should have been an Indian citizen when you are born\n- If you were born on or after 3rd December 2004: Both your parents must be\u00a0 Indian citizens; or if only one of your parents is a citizen, then the other is not an illegal immigrant\n\nThe Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) was notified in March 2024. It offers a fast track to citizenship for persecuted minorities (Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Parsi, Jain, and Christian) from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.\u00a0 They can apply for citizenship through a simplified process if they can show evidence of religious persecution in their home country.The residency requirement for these minorities seeking citizenship has been reduced to 6 years, as opposed to the standard 11 years required for naturalization under other circumstances.\n\nThere are three other procedures that can be followed to become an Indian citizen i.e. bydescent,naturalizationand registration.3Through these, you can also acquire Indian citizenship if you were born outside India in certain cases. Indian residents and others, who are not citizens by birth, canapplyfor Indian citizenship.\n\nTermination of Indian Citizenship\n\nYour status as an Indian citizen can be terminated if:\n\n- You give up your Indian citizenship.4\n- You voluntarily acquire the citizenship of another country.5\n\nFurthermore,\u00a0 if you are not born as an Indian citizen and have acquired citizenship by naturalisation or registration under certain circumstances, then the Government\u00a0 may deprive you of your status as an Indian citizen:\n\n- If you show yourself to bedisloyaltowards the Constitution of India,6\n- If your citizenship\u00a0 was obtainedfraudulently, by false representation or by not revealing crucial facts,7etc.\n- If, during any war India is engaged in, you have unlawfully traded or communicated with an enemy, or knowingly associated with any business assisting the enemy,8\n- If you weresentenced to jail in any countryfor at least 2 years, within 5 years of being registered/naturalized as an Indian citizen,9\n- If you have beenresiding out of India for more than 7 years continuously, without being enrolled in any educational institute in that country, or in the service of Government of India, or an international organization of which India is a member. Your citizenship may also be deprived if, during this time,\u00a0 you have not demonstrated your intention to be an Indian citizen through the prescribed requirements.10\n\nRead this governmentresourceto know more.",

More states may include children with HIV or affected by HIV in the disadvantaged groups for the purpose of RTE.5\n\nChildren belonging to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes are also included under the category of disadvantaged groups in the RTE law. Certain states in India give priority to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in case of 25% admissions to disadvantaged categories in specific categories and unaided private schools. For example, the state of Haryana6provides for a reservation of 5% seats out of the 25% admissions for Scheduled Castes. Similarly, the state of Karnataka has 7.5% and 1.5% seats EWS seats reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes respectively.7\n\nAll children, who are citizens of India have a right to education, including children with disabilities. The Constitution of India provides that nobody can be denied admission into any educational institution based on their religion, race, caste or language8Moreover, the State is directed to provide free and compulsory education for all until the age of 14 years and no child can be denied admission to any educational institution maintained by state funds on grounds such as religion, race, caste or language.9\n\nA child with a disability has special rights for getting an education. Some of these are:\n\nAlso, the government has to take special steps to help children with disabilities get an education including:\n\n- Provision of safe transport facilities to enable them to attend school and complete elementary education.11\n- Materials for special learning and educational support.12\n- Provision of scholarships, part-time classes, informal education and make it easier for such children to give exams etc. A child with 80% disability or two or more disabilities can choose to be educated at home.13",

The causes of air pollution include:2\n\n- Solid Air Pollutant. For example, burning of solid fuels such as firewood, crop residue, cow dung cakes, coal, lignite and charcoal.3\n- Liquid Air Pollutant. For example, use of gasoline, kerosene and diesel in households.\n- Gaseous Air Pollutant. For example, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide and nitrogen.\n- Noise Pollutant. For example, harsh sounds from traffic, engines, generators and fireworks.\n\nThe National Ambient Air QualityStandards, set by the Central Pollution Control Board, lay down the permissible limits of twelve pollutants like sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, trioxygen, lead, carbon monoxide, ammonia, benzene, arsenic, nickel and particulate matter. These limits differ for industrial, residential, rural, ecologically sensitive areas and other areas created by the Central Government.4\n\n\n\nRight to Clean Environment\n\nThe right to a clean environment is a right available to all citizens in India.5Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950 lays down the right to life and personal liberty, which includes the right to pollution-free air6and a clean environment.

      "title": "What are the different types of constitutional remedies?",
      "content": "There are five kinds of constitutional remedies available.1These are:\n\nThe term \u2018habeas corpus\u2019 literally means \u2018produce the body\u2019. In this context, it refers to a direction from a court to bring a person before the court. If a person is illegally restrained and deprived of their liberty, a writ petition forhabeas corpuscan be filed to ask the court to secure their release. The court can issue the writ ofhabeas corpusto any public authority having a person unlawfully in their custody and order the authority to bring the person before the court. In this manner, the court inquires into the circumstances of any person\u2019s detention and can give the necessary judgement against unlawful restraint.((Kanu Sanyal v. District Magistrate, Darjeeling, 1973 AIR 2684.))The court can also issue the writ ofhabeas corpusin cases of illegal inhuman treatment of prisoners.((Sunil Batra v. Delhi Administration, 1980 AIR 1579.))The application forhabeas corpuscan be filed by the imprisoned/detained person or by anyone else who is not an absolute stranger to them.\n\nFor example, if a prisoner is being ill-treated in prison, they can file ahabeas corpuspetition against such treatment.\n\n\n\n2. Mandamus\n\nThe court issues a writ ofmandamusto order an authority to perform their public duty as required by law.((State of Mysore & Anr. v. K.N. Chandrasekhara & Anr., 1965 AIR (SC) 532.))To get this remedy, it is necessary to show that the public authority has a mandatory legal duty and the petitioner has a legal right to enforce its performance.((Rai Shivendra Bahadur v. Governing Body of Nalanda College, AIR 1962 SC 1210.))However, people cannot file for a writ ofmandamusagainst the President of India or the Governor of a State((Article 361, Constitution of India, 1950.)), or officers in legislatures.2Before applying formandamus, the petitioner should have first approached the authority with a distinct demand which the authority refuses to enforce.((Saraswati Industrial Syndicate Ltd. v. Union of India, 1975 AIR 460.))\n\nFor example, if, despite repeated complaints, a Municipal Corporation refuses to perform its legal duty of supplying water to an area, a person living in that area can file amandamuspetition to make the Corporation perform its duty.\n\n\n\n3. Certiorari\n\nThe writ ofcertiorariis applicable when someone with legal authority and a judicial duty to make decisions affecting the rights of people, exceeds their legal authority. The court can issue this remedy to cancel the order of any lower judicial authority which has exceeded its legal powers and made a decision despite not having the power to do so.((Province of Bombay v. Kusaldas S. Advani & Ors., 1950 AIR 222.))\n\nFor example, if an Industrial Tribunal delivers a judgement on a non-industrial dispute without having the authority to do so, an aggrieved person can approach the concerned High Court/Supreme Court with a petition forcertiorarito cancel the Tribunal\u2019s decision.\n\n\n\n4. Prohibition\n\nThe court can issue the writ ofprohibitionto order any lower court/tribunal to stop legal proceedings on a certain matter.((East India Commercial Company Ltd. v. The Collector of Customs, 1962 AIR 1893.))This remedy is used to restrain a lower judicial authority from exceeding its legal authority and to confine lower courts/tribunals within their judicial boundaries.Prohibitioncan also be used in case a lower judicial authority has not obeyed the rules of natural justice i.e. if the authority shows bias or does not hear out both parties.((S. Govinda Menon v. Union of India, 1967 AIR 1274.))\n\nFor example, if an Industrial Tribunal takes up a non-industrial dispute without having the authority to judge the dispute, an aggrieved person can approach the concerned High Court/Supreme Court with a petition forprohibitionto stop the ongoing legal proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\n\n\n5. Quo Warranto\n\nThe writ ofquo warrantois a remedy that allows the court to ask any person who holds a public office to prove their right to hold the office. In case they don\u2019t have the right to hold the public position, they will be removed from that office by judicial order. This remedy controls the executive from making illegal appointments to a public office and protects citizens from people who illegally hold public office depriving citizens of their rights. To claimquo warranto, a petitioner has to show the court that the office is a public office and that the person holding it has no legal authority to hold the office. This will lead to an inquiry on whether their appointment has been made legally.(( TheUniversity of Mysore v. Govinda Rao, 1965 AIR 41.))\n\nFor example, if someone feels that the Speaker of a Legislative Assembly does not have the qualifications to hold this public office, they can approach the\u00a0 Court to issue a writ ofquo warrantoto inquire about the appointment.\n\n",

Then, the court can decide to refer the case to a Conciliation Officer, who will try to get the parties to agree to a friendly settlement. If the court does not refer the case, it will listen to both the parties.\n\nThe court will conduct an inquiry to figure out how much maintenance you need to be paid. An inquiry is not a full-fledged legal proceeding. Even though the law does not allow for representation by lawyers in these courts, there are high court judgments which have held that this right of lawyers cannot be restricted. This court is slightly informal in nature but it has the powers of a civil court and can order attendance of witnesses, take evidence on oath, etc.\n\nIf the court finds that your children or relatives are neglecting to take care of you, it can pass an order directing them to pay a monthly maintenance. The court can also order that interest (between 5% and 8%) be paid on the maintenance amount from the date of the application. If your children or parents are not paying the maintenance even after the court order, you can go to any similar court (maintenance tribunal) and ask for help in enforcing the order.",

      "content": "One of the most critical aspects to consider when buying a land or house, is knowing whether:\n\nThe price of the property is fair\n\nSince land and property fall under State subjects as per the Constitution of India, laws and transactional rules vary depending on the state where the property is located. Depending on where the property is located and the nature of construction (if applicable), different states have introduced a system of determining a minimum base price for the property, called \u2018circle rate\u2019, or \u2018ready reckoner rate\u2019. These circle rates are speculative and vary greatly even within the same city- from one area to another- and are frequently updated and notified. In addition to the location-based circle rates, the value of a property is also affected by the services it has access to, and the builder/ housing society. However, these circle rates only serve as guides, and the actual price may vary based on the market value of the property, called fair market value.\n\nThe ownership of the property is free of disputes\n\nThere are various ways in which you can find out if the ownership of the property you want to purchase is disputed. The simplest way is to check the title deeds of the property in question. You can also enquire with the local tehsildar\u2019s office or that of the village officer where the property is located. Other documents such as e-record of rights, property tax receipts, and survey documents are also used to establish ownership.",

This household can be owned/leased by either you, the harasser , or the both of you, and also includes households that belong to the joint family of which the harasser is a part, even if you do not have a legal right in it.\n\nHowever, if the property is the exclusive, personal property of the parents-in-law, or any other relative of the harasser, you do not have a right to claim any share in that house, as that is not a shared household.(( S.R. Batra v. Taruna Batra (2007) 3 SCC 169.))\u00a0 However, the Court will ultimately decide whether or not to allow you to reside in a particular house according to the facts of the case, so you may be allowed to reside in a house owned by your mother-in-law in some cases.\u00a0 Seeherefor more details on residence orders.\n\nPlease note that it is not necessary that the violence has taken place only in the house where you reside; it can take placeanywhere.\n\nSome states provide handbooks for ASHA workers where you can find more information on forms on violence, where it can happen and how to file a complaint to seek protection against domestic violence. For example, seethis handbookpublished for ASHA in Chattisgarh, Delhi, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand.",

In this case, Aman must give it to Simran otherwise he will be punished under the law.\n\n- If the property was received before the wedding, then Aman must give it to Simran within 3 months of the wedding (before 20th November)\n- If the property was received on the day of the wedding or after, then Aman must give it to Simran within 3 months from the date on which he received it.\n- If Simran was below 18 at the time of her wedding, then Aman must give the car to Simran within 3 months of her turning 18. Aman must keep it in trust for her till she turns 18.\n\nIf you die before taking possession of the dowry/property, then your heirs can claim it from your husband or in-laws.\n\nIf you die within 7 years of the marriage, then the property will be transferred to your children. It will be held in trust for them until they are 18. If you have no children, the property will go to your parents.",

If you are unable to repay the money, you may lose ownership over the asset which you have offered as a collateral to the lender. For the lender, the collateral acts as a safety net.\n\nWhen seeking a bank loan (business, education etc), especially when it is for a higher amount, banks require individuals to offer some asset as collateral for security. For this purpose, you can offer either self-occupied residential or commercial property. You will be required to provide proof of ownership in the form of title deeds at the time of registering for a loan. The banks decide the credibility and the value of the land / house being offered as a collateral against the requested amount for the loan.

However,a persondoes not haveto go through any surgeries to be given recognition with their self-identified gender.1. In this regard, given below are two of the most common forms of surgeries performed:\n\n- Gender Affirmative Therapy (GAT)is a set of procedures, from psychological counselling to sex reassignment surgeries, which aim to change a persons appearance so that it will conform more strongly with the self-identified gender.\u00a0 For example, Rita was identified to be female at birth, but while growing up, identifies herself as male, and may undergo GAT to masculinize her appearance through breast removal surgery, etc.\n\nThe Supreme Court1has held that it is a constitutional right for a person to be affirmed as male or female after the respective GAT, and that there is no impediment, legal or otherwise, in undergoing GAT.\n\n- Corrective surgery/intersex surgeryrefers to procedures done to modify sex characteristics and genitals when they are anomalous, meaning when there is no clear distinction between male and female genitals. \u00a0For example, a child, Nakul, is born with both male and female genitalia, and decides that he self-identifies and feels that his gender is male, and thus, undergoes corrective surgery to align more strongly to the male gender.\n\nThough nation-wide regulations do not exist, some states, like Tamil Nadu, have banned unnecessary medical procedures on infants, to prevent illegal corrective surgery at a young age2.\n\nIn India, there are no guidelines for eligibility, procedure, etc. or laws on GAT or Corrective Surgery.\n\nIf a person faces any discrimination while accessing medical or psychological healthcare, they can take action to alleviate the problem.

      "content": "All children between the ages of6 to 14 yearscan get education from schools, free of cost,\u00a0 from the 1st standard (first class) till the 8th standard (eighth class).\n\nChildren can attend classes in neighbourhood schools. These neighbourhood schools are schools established within a walking distance of:\n\n- one kilometre from the child\u2019s neighbourhood (if the child is in class I to V) and\n- three kilometres (if the child is in class VI to VIII).1\n\nHowever, the law does not restrict the education of children to neighbourhood schools.2The child isfree to enrol in any schooldespite the distance from the child\u2019s neighbourhood to receive an education free of cost. However, it is important to note that a child can receive education only from thoseschoolsestablished, owned (e.g. state established schools like Kendriya Vidyalaya, Aarohi schools in Haryana etc.), controlled or substantially funded directly or indirectly by the government or local authority. So if a child is admitted to schools other than those given above, their parents cannot make a claim for reimbursement of expenses for the child\u2019s education.3This, however, does not include admissions under the25% reserved admissions for disadvantaged groups.4The admission process for schools covered by the Right to Education varies from state to state. However, certain practices are common. For admitting a child to the school, the following are the common practices across states:\n\nParents are required to fill a form provided by the requisite state governments. These forms are available on the government portal as every state has a separate portal for admissions. Some examples arePunjab,Maharashtraetc. You can also approach neighbourhood schools to obtain the form.5The form includes basic information like the family details, address etc. It also provides for choosing preferred schools in case of unplanned admissions. A maximum of five schools can be provided as preferences.6\n\nCertain documents are mandatory to be submitted. These documents include the child\u2019s ID asproof of age(may entail a birth certificate, Anganwadi record,Aadhar cardetc.) and parents\u2019 IDs. Forms also enlist the provision of documents such as the family\u2019sration card, income certificate, caste certificate as well as relevant certificates highlighting the special needs of children. Such a filled form may ordinarily be submitted to the neighbourhood school. Since certain states have made the entire process online, so the application may be carried on the government portal.\n\nChildren can get admission to schools without paying any fees or expenses.7The right to education law in India prohibits invocation of any fees prior to the admission of a child. No school is allowed to charge any capitation fee which refers to any kind of donation or payment other than the school fee.8\n\nMoreover, schools cannot subject the child or the parents to any form of screening procedure before admission.A screening procedure may involve any test or interview of the child or the parent for the purposes of admission to the school.9The school should randomly select the children and employ an open lottery method for filling up vacant seats. This can be done in the form of writing the names of the children on paper slips and then randomly picking them out of a container to ensure transparency. Schools may be fined up to Rs.25,000 for the first contravention of this provision and may extend to Rs.50,000 for any subsequent contraventions.9",

The Commission accepts or rejects a complaint within a period of 21 days. If the commission does not respond in the specified time, the complaint will be accepted and looked into by the District Commissions(( Section 36(2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). Before rejecting a complaint, the commission must give the complainant the opportunity to be heard. The Commission has the power to order for the removal of any problems or defects from the goods or services availed, or it can order a payment of fine(( Section 39, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.))as a relief to the complainant. The parties to a case also have the option to file an appeal against the order of the District Commission to the State Commission within 45 days of the District Commission order(( Section 41, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). You can find details of the district commissions given in the National Consumer Redressalwebsite.\n\nState Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (SCDRC)\n\nThe State Commission is a state-level complaint redressal forum located at the capital(( Section 42(2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.))of the respective state where complaints with respect to goods having value between Rupees 1 crore to 10 crores can be filed. There are about 35state commissionsin the country where complaints, appeals from the District Commission, and cases about unfair contracts are heard(( Section 47(1), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). An appeal against the decision of the State Commission can be filed with the National Commission, within 30 days from the date of the order(( Section 51, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). Once such an appeal is filed, it is required to be decided within 90 days by the National Commission(( Section 52, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)).\n\nNational Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC):\n\nThe National Commission is the upper-most authority for consumer complaints redressals.

An appeal against the decision of the National Commission can be filed with the Supreme Court within a period of 30 days from the date of the order passed(( Section 67, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)). The orders of the Commission are published on itswebsite. The Commission has the legal right to publish the orders and no proceedings can be brought against the Commission for publishing these orders(( Rule 12(8), Consumer Protection (Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission) Rules, 2020.)). The National Commission portal also provides video instructions pertaining to registration and filing of an electroniccomplaintthrough its forum.\n\nTime for deciding complaints\n\nA consumer complaint must be decided by the Commissions within a period of 3 months. This may be extended to 5 months in case there is a requirement for testing of the products/defects(( Section 38(7), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)).\n\nAppeals for orders passed by Commissions\n\nThe order passed by the Commissions are final if they have not been appealed in the specified period of time(( Section 68, Consumer Protection Act, 2019.)).

This is ensured through various means such as fines, taking back the defective goods(( Section 20(a), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)), reimbursements for such goods/services(( Section 20(b), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)), or discontinuation of unfair trade practices(( Section 20(c), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n\nThe manufacturer, advertiser or endorser is liable for false ormisleading advertisements.However, the endorser\u2019s liability in these cases only arises when they have not done their research(( Section 21(5), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))before endorsing such an advertisement. The punishment is:\n\n- For the first offence: A fine which may extend up to Rs. 10 lakh and jail time up to 2 years5(( Section 89 & Section 21 (2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- For every repeat offence: A fine which may extend up toRs. 50 lakh and jail time up to 5 yearsmay be awarded(( Section 89 & Section 21 (2), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- The Central Authority can also prohibit them from endorsinganyproduct for up to1 year. In case of subsequent offences, it can be extended up to 3 years(( Section 21(3), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- Failure to comply with these directions of theCentral Authoritycan result in jail time for up to6 months or a fine extending to Rs. 20 lakh((Section 88,Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n\n\n\nAny action of the manufacturer or retailer involving the sale, import, storage or distribution of adulterated food is punishable. The following punishments apply:\n\n- When there is no injury((Section 2(23), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))to the consumer, like any kind of pain or death, jail time for up to 6 months and a fine of up to Rs. 1 lakh may be granted((Section 90(1)(a), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- When the injury does not amount to grievous hurt to the consumer, jail time for up to 1 year and a fine of up to Rs. 3 lakhs may be granted((Section 90(1)(b), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- When thereisgrievous hurt to the consumer, jail time for up to 7 years and a fine of up to Rs. 5 lakhs may be granted((Section 90(1)(c), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n- When the adulteration has caused the death of the consumer, jail time for not less than 7 years and extending up to life, and a fine of not less than Rs. 10 lakhs may be granted((Section 90(1)(d), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n\nAdditionally, the Consumer Authority may suspend the license of the manufacturer for up to 2 years, when it is the first offence or cancel the license of such manufacturer altogether if the offence is repeated((Section 90(3), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)).\n\nSpurious goods are those which are falsely claimed to be genuine((Section 2(43), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))or are fake or imitative of real, original goods.

It includes the production, distribution, marketing, sale or delivery of goods and services byelectronic means(( Electronic Commerce, WTO, accessed at https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/minist_e/mc11_e/briefing_notes_e/bfecom_e.htm#:~:text=Electronic%20commerce%2C%20or%20e%2Dcommerce,and%20services%20by%20electronic%20means%22.&text=These%20WTO%20bodies%20were%20instructed,WTO%20agreements%20and%20e%2Dcommerce.)).\n\nE-commerce entities, such as online shopping websites like Flipkart(( Ajay Kumar v. Flipkart Internet Private Limited, 2018 SCC OnLine NCDRC 549.))and Amazon(( Kent RO Systems v. Amazon Seller Services, 2017 SCC OnLine Del 8016.)), have long been treated as service providers who work for a profit(( Rediff.Com India Limited v. Ms. Urmil Munjal, 2013(2) C.P.C. 536.)). They have been held liable whenever there has been a violation of consumer rights. One of the major reforms brought about by the Consumer Protection Act, 2019 is that it lays down a set of rules to govern these e-commerce entities(( Consumer Protection (E-Commerce Rules), 2020.)):\n\n- E-commerce entities will have to respond within 48 hours of complaint.\n- Complaints can be made from any place, regardless of where the purchase was made.\n- E-commerce entities such as Amazon, Flipkart, are now required to display the details of the sellers, such as their legal name, geographic address, contact details, etc.\n- These entities must not directly or indirectly manipulate the goods\u2019 prices, and must not adopt any unfair or deceptive methods of sale.\n- They are prohibited from exaggerating the qualities of a product, and posting fake reviews.\n- The law mandates the protection of consumers\u2019 personal information so that personal details are kept confidential and the privacy of consumers is protected.\n\nAn advertisement is a promotion through television, radio, or any other electronic media, newspapers, banners, posters, handbills, wall-writing etc. A misleading advertisement says untrue things about the goods and services, which can mislead the consumer in\u00a0 buying them(( Misleading Advertisements, Department of Consumer Affairs, accessed at https://consumeraffairs.nic.in/more/misleading-advertisements. These advertisements may make false claims about a product or services\u2019 usefulness((Section 2(47)(f), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)), quality and quantity(( Section 2(28)(ii), Consumer Protection Act, 2019)), or deliberately conceal important information about the product(( Section 2(28)(iv), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))(such as known side-effects), etc. Advertisers can be sued for making misleading claims in their advertisements. These include claims of being the first toothpaste to have a certain beneficial composition when it actually isn\u2019t(( Colgate Palmolive (India) Ltd. v. Anchor Health & Beauty Care P. Ltd., (2008) 7 MLJ 1119.)), or advertising schemes that seek to increase profits without passing on the benefit to the consumers(( Society of Catalysts v. Vodafone Essar Mobile Services Limited, LNIND 2008 SCDRCD 962.)), etc.\n\nUnfair trade practices have a broad definition under the consumer protection law. They include false statements about the goods\u2019 standard, quality and quantity, and the marketing of used/second-hand goods as new goods. It also includes false claims about a warranty, or the warranty period being scientifically untested, etc. This has resulted in several lawsuits, one involving a noodle-maker labelling its packets with false lead content(( M/S Nestle India Limited v. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India, W.P. L. No. 1688 of 2015.)), replacing the labels of pharmaceutical drugs to extend the expiry period(( Pooja Roy v. Krishnango Bhattacharya, C.R.R 2796 of 2008, Calcutta H.C.)), marketing adulterated goods with different ingredients than stated on the label(( Consumer Guidance Society v. Amway India Enterprises, (2007) C.C 140 of 2007.)), etc.\n\nRestrictive trade practice means a trade practice which tends to manipulate the price, or delivery, of goods, which affect the flow of supplies in the market. This leads to the consumers facing unfair costs or restrictions. This is usually done in some of the following ways: price fixing, dealing exclusively, restricting the resale values of sold goods, mandating that buying one good or service entails buying other goods or services. One real-life example of this is the inbuilt price of delivery and fixing electronic goods. This ensures that the consumer ends up paying for the service, whether they want to or not, making them bear unfair costs.\n\nDefective goods are goods(( Sections 2(10) and 2(11), Consumer Protection Act, 2019.))with any fault, imperfection or shortcoming in the quality, quantity, purity or standard which is required to be maintained by the seller, under the law in force. Some examples are adulterated or imperfectly brewed beverages, malfunctioning machinery, misshapen artifacts, etc.\n\nSpurious goods are those which are falsely claimed to be genuine(( Section 2(43), Consumer Protection Act, 2019))or are fake or imitative of real, original goods. These are often of inferior quality and infringe upon the trademarks and copyrights of legal owners of the original goods. A crucial example is that of medicines or cheap make-up products found in local markets. Often, spurious medicines are marketed under another drug\u2019s name, or imitate/substitute another drug in a deceptive way(( Drugs and Cosmetics FAQs, Integrated Grievance Redressal Mechanism, accessed at https://consumerhelpline.gov.in/faq-details.php?fid=Drugs%20and%20Cosmetics.)).\n\nOvercharging generally occurs in covert ways, when sellers charge the consumer more than what is prescribed as the Maximum Retail Price of a product. It is a gross violation of consumer rights.\n\nPresently, the law also addresses grievances related to food products. For example, customers can file their grievances about packaged food like the presence of adulterant, expired goods, missing FSSAI license, etc. or serving issues like the lack of hygiene, presence of pests, etc. at the Food Safety ConnectPortal.\n\n",

These two laws in many ways have led the reforms in family laws. However, Muslim marriages are guided by the Islamic religious precepts. In Islam, there are two sects- Sunni and Shia. Each sect practices different schools of law. This means that depending on the sect, the marriage procedure differs for a bride and a groom.((Mulla, D. F., Sir.

The ideal way to ensure smooth transfer of property ownership following someone\u2019s death is through a will. To know more about wills, read ourexplainer.\n\nHowever, if there is no will, i.e., an intestacy, law of inheritance applies to decide distribution of the property. In India, personal laws, customary laws and legislative laws govern the law of inheritance of property. The broad laws are the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and Islamic personal laws.\n\nUnder the Hindu law of inheritance, a person/owner can deal with their self-acquired property as they like, but there are restrictions about transfer of ancestral property. The law gives certain family members a birthright to ancestral properties. Brothers and sisters are entitled to equal shares in the property of their mother or father under the Hindu law of inheritance. Here, the terms \u2018son\u2019 and \u2018daughter\u2019 include adopted sons and daughters, but not stepchildren.\n\nIf the survivors have a dispute over immovable property, and the owner of the property does not have a will, they can file a suit before court.\n\nIn the case of Muslim law of inheritance, the personal laws that apply depend on which sub-sect one belongs to, i.e., Sunni or Shia. The laws are not codified, which means that there is no act setting them down. For Sunnis following Hanafi Law, personal law restricts legacies to a maximum of one-third of the estate remaining after taking care of funeral expenses, outstanding wages of domestic servants and debts.",

It follows the same format as that of a partition deed. It is not mandatory to register and stamp the family settlement agreement. However, all family members should sign it voluntarily, that is, without any fraud or coercion or undue pressure from any family member or anyone.\n\nPartition Suit\n\nA suit for partition of property, is a court case filed when the family members cannot agree on the terms and conditions of dividing the property. In such cases, the family members usually want to divide the property according to their shares in it.

The purpose of this law is to prohibit coercion during the gift exchange.\n\nGifts from the bride\u2019s side should be according to custom and as per financial capacity of her family. For example, in marriages in certain societies, sarees and jewellery are given to women relatives of both the bride and groom, by the other side. This is done as per custom and therefore would not be considered as dowry. There may be other customs of giving certain gifts.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the groom\u2019s family cannot force a bride to give the gifts per the custom as this would be demanding dowry. Generally, gifts given should be of a value which do not create an extraordinary financial burden to the person giving them.(( Provision to Section 3, Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961)) For example, if the bride\u2019s father has to take a loan of a significant amount to buy gifts for the groom\u2019s side, then it cannot be said that the gift has been given as per financial capacity of the person.

      "content": "While anything that lowers the authority of the courts can be considered as contempt, there are certain exceptions given in the law.\n\nUnder the law, if a publication, like a book or an article, tends to prejudice any pending court proceeding, such as publicly discussing unsubstantiated evidence, it will amount to criminal contempt.((Rachapudi Subba Rao v Advocate General, Andhra Pradesh, AIR 1981 SC 755; Read with Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Sections 2(c) (ii) & (iii)))However, the law itself gives certain exceptions where a publication will not amount to contempt on the grounds of prejudicing a pending proceeding. They are:\n\n- If at the time of publication, the publisher had no reason to believe that such a case was pending.((Section 3(1), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n- If no court proceeding was pending at the time of publication.((Section 3(2), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n- If the person is in charge of distributing something that may be seen as contempt and they did not know that it contained anything that would be prejudicial to an ongoing court proceeding.((Section 3(3), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n- However, this defence of \u2018innocent distribution\u2019 is not available for the press as the law gives certain criteria to be met for publishing books,((Section 3, Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867.))papers,((Section 3, Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867.))and newspapers((Section 5, Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867.)). A person found distributing books, papers, or newspapers that have not met these criteria, will be guilty of contempt.((Proviso to Section 3(3), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n\nIn India, trials and other judicial proceedings are generally held in open court and are subject to public scrutiny. This is required for a healthy, objective, and fair administration of justice.((Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar v State of Maharashtra, AIR 1967 SC 1.))This system relies on numerous reporters that accurately report the daily proceedings in a court. The law protects such legal reporting, provided that it is fair and accurate.((Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Section 4.))\n\nThe terms \u2018fair and accurate, does not mean that the report should be a word-to-word reproduction of the proceedings. Rather, it should relay what has happened in the court,((Borrie & Lowe, The Law of Contempt, LexisNexis Butterworths, 3rd Edn, p 270.))and should not misrepresent the court proceedings before the public.((Roach v. Garvan, (1742) 2 Atk 469.))Unfair reporting that misleads the readers, is not protected by the law and would amount to contempt.((E.T. Sen v E. Narayanan, AIR 1969 Del 201, at 213.))For example, reporting or quoting an incorrect statement which was not made by a judge on social media.\n\n\n\nIn situations of in-camera trials, which take place in a closed room inside a court, certain forms of reporting may amount to contempt. Some examples of in-camera trials are cases of rape,((Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Section 327(2)))matrimonial disputes,((Special Marriage Act, 1954, Section 33 for example.))etc, In such in-camera proceedings, the reporting of the proceedings, even if they are fair and accurate, will amount to contempt if:\n\n- Such publication is contrary to or against any existing law.((Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Section 7(1)(a).))For example, reporting of the proceedings inrapetrials or child sexual abusetrialsare prohibited by law, and a person has to obtain the permission of the court in case they want to still report such matters.((Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, Section 327(3).))\n- The court has explicitly prohibited such reporting.((Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Section 7(1)(b).))For example, in the evidence stage of a case involving national security or terrorism.\n- The court is conducting in-camera proceedings for reasons connected with public order or security of the State.((Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, Section 7(1)(c).))\n- The information published relates to a secret process, discovery or invention which is an issue in proceedings. For example, in patent objection matters.((Section 7(1)(d), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))\n\nIf a case has been finally heard and decided by the court, a person will be allowed to publish fair comments on the merits of that particular case.((Section 5, Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))Comments about the judgment itself, and other comments about the merits of the case, are an exception to contempt of court.((Samaraditya Pal, The Law of Contempt-Contempt of Courts and Legislatures, Chapter 5, Defenses, Punishments, Procedures, Limitation and Conferment of Rule Making Power (5th edn, 2012).))Since judgments are public documents, and the public acts of a Judge are subject to public scrutiny , no one can prohibit fair comments on either of them.((Rama Dayal Markarha v. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1978 SC 921, at 927.))However, the exact test for \u2018fair comment\u2019 is unclear and will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. For example, misquoting the judge or making false statements about judges would not amount to \u2018fair comment\u2019. Additionally, such comments have to be made without any bad intentions, and without the motive to bring down the image of the judiciary or impair the administration of justice itself.((In re: Ajay Kumar Pandey, (1998) 7 SCC 248.))\n\nIf a person has made a complaint against a presiding officer of a Subordinate Court, to either the High Court or another Subordinate Court, such a complaint will not amount to contempt. However, such a complaint has to be made in good faith.((Section 6, Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))For example, if a person files a complaint against a District Judge because of a legitimate grievance.\n\nSaying or publishing the truth for the public good may be treated by the court as an exception to contempt.((Section 13(b), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))This is similar to the defence oftruthin defamation, but the court has the option to decide whether or not to accept such a remark.",

      "content": "The following Covid-19 tests are done in India1:\n\nRapid Antigen Test (RAT):\n\nAn antigen refers to any foreign matter or viral proteins in the body that triggers an immune response. This test helps identify the antigens related to the Covid-19 virus. Antigen test, also known asrapid antigen test,is a rapid diagnostic test, but these tests have a higher chance of missing an active infection.\n\nRT-PCR:\n\nRT-PCR is a method of testing that is used to directly detect the presence of the virus in the sample. The test detects the RNA(Ribonucleic acid) of the virus which is the genetic material of the virus.\n\nTrueNat\n\nTrueNat is a chip-based, portable RT-PCR machine, originally developed as a portable diagnostic tool for tuberculosis. The latest versions of the TrueNat machine can detect an enzyme (called RdRp) found in the RNA of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAntibody test\n\nAn antibody test,also known as Serology test, is a screening test for Covid-19 antibodies in the blood. It tells if someone was previously infected with the virus that causes Covid-19. The antibody test does not look for the active virus but checks whether the immune system has responded to the infection.\n\nThe Government\u00a0 has arranged for\u00a0 free Covid-19 testing\u00a0 at approved laboratories across India. Although the test is not free in private labs and hospitals, the Supreme Court(( Shashank Deo Sudhi v. Union of India, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 358)).has stated that free testing should be done for the poor who are eligible under theAyushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Aarogya Yojana.Beneficiaries of this scheme will be able to\u00a0 access\u00a0 free testing in private labs and access to Covid-19 treatment at government empanelled hospitals.\n\nTo get tested\u00a0 free of cost, a person can go to any government hospital. Calling thehelpline numbersbefore getting a test done will enable a person to get updated information. Please seeherefor the list of government and\u00a0 private clinics for testing of Covid-19, as released by Indian Council of Medical Research.",

If anyone obstructs their entry, they can even break open the door or remove any obstacle in their way.\n\nSearching a person\n\nIf an authorised police officer wants to search you, you can ask the search to be conducted in the presence of a magistrate or certain gazetted officers. Once you make this request, you can be detained by the police officer till you can be brought before a magistrate or an appropriate gazetted officer. However, if the police officer believes that it is not possible to wait for a gazetted officer or a magistrate, he can proceed with the search.2\n\nPlease note that women can only be searched by a woman officer.\n\nSeizure\n\nIn the process of the search, the police officer also has the power to seize the following:\n\n- Drugs, substances and anything used to manufacture it\n- Any article, vehicle or animal that may have been used in the process\n- Any documents or articles that can be evidence and prove that a crime in relation to drugs was committed\n\nArrest\n\nWhile carrying out the search and seizure, if the police officer believes that a crime has been committed in relation to drugs or narcotics, he can even arrest the suspected person. He may not always need a warrant for such an arrest.3\n\nThese powers of search, seizure and arrest of a police officer also extend to a public place like a hotel, restaurant, shop or any other place accessible to the public.4\n\nYou have certain rights when you are arrested. To know more about these rights, please readhere.\n\nImmediate Cases \u2013 No Warrant Needed\n\nWhile ideally this search and seizure has to be done in the day time, i.e. between sunrise and sunset and with a warrant from an appropriate judge, if the police officer believes that in the time taken to obtain the warrant the necessary evidence could be concealed or the suspect may escape, he can carry out the search and seizure without a warrant. In such cases he will have to note down his reasons for doing this in writing and inform his immediate supervisor within 72 hours.5\n\n",

It was declared a disturbed area because of the rise in insurgency and militancy during that time.",

      "content": "Contempt of court is any action or writing, meant to lower the authority of a court or a Judge or to interfere with the course of justice or the lawful process of the court. The Contempt of Court Act, 1971, defines contempt of court to include two kinds-civil and criminal contempt.((Section 2(a), Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))A contempt proceeding is not a dispute between two parties, but rather a proceeding between the court and the person accused of contempt.1\n\nTypes of Contempt of Court\n\nContempt of court can be broadly categorized into two \u2013civil and criminal contempt.\n\nCivil contempt refers to:\n\n- Willful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order or writ. For example, D disobeyed a court order to submit her financial records to the court in an ongoing case. This would be an instance of civil contempt.\n- A willful breach of an undertaking or affidavit given to a court. For example, V submitted an affidavit to the court that she would return certain confidential papers to her employer within a week but failed to return it within that time period. This would be an instance of civil contempt.2The undertaking or affidavit given to the court can be in the form of a promise or a direction, based on which the court decides whether something was done or not.3)For example, not following an undertaking/affidavit where a person has promised to pay a certain amount of money to the court. The main intention of this law is to ensure that people uphold the sanctity of the judicial system and obey the directions given by the court.((Subrata Kunda v Kshiti Goswami, Calcutta HC, 2010 (1) CHN 306.))Criminal ContemptCriminal contempt does not require the existence of a judgment, order, direction, decree, writ, or undertaking/affidavit. For criminal contempt, the law requires apublication or action or an attempt, which has any of the following consequences:Scandalisesorlowerthe authority of any court. For example, if someone deliberatelydefamesand raises their voice at a judge.Prejudices, orinterfereswith any court or tribunal proceeding. For example, a false statement made against a judge for collusion in their capacity as a \u2018judge\u2019.Obstructsthe administration of justice in any other manner.((Section 2(c) , Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.))For example, if a person stops municipal authorities who have been told by the Court to demolish a building.The aim of criminal contempt is not to protect the court from insult, but rather to prevent dilution of the public\u2019s faith in the courts.((Delhi Judicial Service Association, Tis Hazari Court v. the State of Gujarat, (1991) 4 SCC 406.))\n- Scandalisesorlowerthe authority of any court. For example, if someone deliberatelydefamesand raises their voice at a judge.\n- Prejudices, orinterfereswith any court or tribunal proceeding.

      "content": "Air pollution is associated with many sectors, which include power, transport, industry, residential, construction, and agriculture.\n\nBurning of fossil fuels and emissions\n\nThe majority of air pollution comes from the use of energy like the burning of fossil fuels which releases toxic gases and chemicals into the air.1The two most common types of air pollution are smog and soot, caused by burning of fossil fuels like coal or natural gases. The small airborne particles present in soot or smog are extremely dangerous, as they enter lungs and blood and can lead to bronchitis and heart diseases which can be fatal.\n\nOther sources of harmful air pollutants are in the emissions from industry, vehicles, road dust, construction, garbage burning, domestic households and diesel generator sets.1\n\nUse of Air Conditioners\n\nIncreased use of air conditioners leads to a direct increase in the demand for electricity. This demand for electricity consequently increases the dependence on fossil fuels to meet the collective energy needs. The electricity sector, thus, is the largest source of polluting greenhouse gas emissions. Increased levels of greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for climate change and air pollution. Therefore, increased usage of air conditioners is one of the causes of air pollution and is a threat to public health.2\n\nHowever, a case cannot be filed against any single individual for such an act, as no one person is solely responsible for the increased demand of energy or air pollution. It is a result of increased use of air conditioners as a community which leads to these harmful effects of air pollution.\n\nVehicular Pollution\n\nEmissions from vehicles are the source of 60-70% of overall air pollution. The Government is trying to control such emissions through measures like stricter mass emission standards and protocols, phasing out of old vehicles,3increased awareness about vehicle maintenance and lane discipline, revised fuel efficiency norms like use of alternative fuel programmes and blending of biofuels, promotion of electric or hybrid vehicles and increased use of public transport like metros, e-rickshaws.4\n\nEffects of Air Pollution\n\nClimate Change\n\nAir pollution is both the cause as well as an effect of climate change. The emissions of carbon dioxide and methane raise the earth\u2019s temperature. Consequently, increased heat leads to smog (smoke and fog) and increased UV radiation.5\n\nHealth Impacts\n\nAir pollution is extremely concerning due to its life-threatening health impacts. However, the impact of air pollution is not limited to health but extends to agriculture and the general well-being of human, plant and animal life. Other effects of air pollution can be irritation of the eyes and throat, damage to the lungs and can trigger allergies and asthma attacks.1Long term exposure to polluted air may also cause skin problems, harm to liver and reproductive organs. Presence of hazardous chemicals, like lead and mercury, in the air can damage children\u2019s brain function.5Patients with lung or heart ailments are more vulnerable to the effects of air pollution.",

      "content": "Noisecan disturb our work, rest, sleep, and communication. It can damage our hearing and evoke other psychological, and possibly pathological reactions. Given below are some of the adverse health effects of noise pollution:1\n\nHearing loss can be either temporary or permanent.\n\n- Noise-induced temporary threshold shift (NITTS) is a temporary loss of hearing experienced after a relatively short exposure to excessive noise.\n- Noise-induced permanent threshold shift (NIPTS) is an irreversible loss of hearing that is caused by prolonged noise exposure. NIPTS occurs typically at high frequencies, usually with a maximum hearing loss which occurs around 4000 Hertz.\n\nBoth these losses may occur along with presbycusis, which is a permanent hearing impairment that happens with our natural aging process.\n\nNoise interferes with speech communication. If both noise and speech are simultaneous, then one of the two sounds makes the other one inaudible. An important aspect of communication interference happens in:\n\n- Occupational situations where the failure of workers to hear warning signals or shouts may lead to injury.\n- In offices, schools and homes where noise is a major source of annoyance.\n\nNoise intrusion can cause difficulty in falling asleep and can awaken people who are asleep, especially young infants, older people, etc.\n\nNoise annoyance may be defined as a feeling of displeasure evoked by noise. The annoyance-inducing capacity of a noise may happen over time also. For example, if the loudspeaker plays near your house for more than 1 month, then over time you may be annoyed. However, reactions to noise differ person to person depending on many factors, such as sensitivity to noise, etc. For example, you may be able to tolerate noise from a speaker near your house but your grandparents may be more sensitive to noise.\n\nNoise can change the state of alertness of an individual and may increase or decrease efficiency. For example mental activities involving vigilance, information-gathering and analysis may be affected by noise.\n\nNoise has an explicit effect on the blood vessels, especially the smaller ones known as pre-capillaries. Overall, noise makes these blood vessels narrower. Noise causes the peripheral blood vessels in the toes, fingers, skin and abdominal organs to constrict, thereby decreasing the amount of blood normally supplied to these areas. Blood vessels which feed the brain, dilate in the presence of noise. This is the reason why headaches result from listening to persistent high noise. Some health problems which may occur include:\n\n- Galvanic skin response. In other words, changes in the body originating from sweat glands in the skin that reflect the intensity of an emotional state.\n- Increased activity related to ulcer formation. Prolonged chronic noise can also produce stomach ulcers as it may reduce the flow of gastric juice and change its acidity.\n- Changes in intestinal motility which is the movements of the digestive system, and the contents within it.\n- Changes in skeletal muscle tension. In other words, the force generated by the contraction of muscles changes.\n- Subjective response irritability perception of loudness\n- Increased sugar, cholesterol and adrenaline\n- Changes in heart rate\n- Increased blood pressure\n- Vasoconstriction. In other words, the constriction of blood vessels which increases blood pressure.\n\nNoise not only causes harmful consequences to health while being awake. It also effects when the body is asleep or unaware2\n\nNoise may cause stress in any number of ways, including headaches, irritability, insomnia, digestive disorders, and psychological disorders. For example, frequent exposure to excessive noise cause tiredness.\n\nThe foetus is not fully protected from noise. Noise may threaten foetal development, like affecting the birth weight. Levels of noise which do not affect adults may interfere significantly with children as they are more sensitive. Reading ability, speech, language, and language-related skills of children may be affected due to noise pollution.",

The making and execution of wills is governed by the Indian Succession Act of 1925, which applies to all religions except Islam.\n\nDrafting a last will and testament ensures that your property is safely and securely distributed amongst your beneficiaries, as per your wishes. This would avoid intestacy and minimize the chances of a dispute over right of inheritance and avoid long-drawn court processes. You need to name an executor (who will carry out all the proceedings of the will) and a legal guardian for your children if they are minors.\n\nTo know more, do read the Nyaaya explainer onWills.",

However, there is no definition of the term \u2018Dangerous Epidemic Disease\u2019under this law.\n\nThroughout the lockdown in India, the Central and State Governments took several actions to control the spread of the disease by:\n\n- Restricting spread and movement by enforcing lockdowns or curfews.\n- Conducting Covid-19 checks at airports.\n- Travel bans within and between States.\n- Stopping non-essential activities like movie theatres, amusement parks etc.\n- Stopping schools from opening and encouraging online teaching methods.\n- Preventing mass gatherings at weddings, funerals etc.\n- Stopping industries and construction activities.\n- Shutting down offices and workplaces.\n\nState Governments also have the power1to take measures to prevent the outbreak of an epidemic, by prescribing regulations to be enforced with respect to any person or group of people. An example of this would be Delhi Epidemics Diseases, COVID-19 Regulations, 2020, continuously passed by the Delhi Government to restrict gatherings.\n\nSince the Covid-19 outbreak is a\u201cNotified Disaster\u201d, the Disaster Management Act, 2005 applies to it and State Governments will get access to appropriate funds in order to respond and provide immediate relief to victims of the disaster. Through this law, the government can take/has taken action to manage the Covid-19 disaster by:\n\n- Preventing its\u00a0 danger or threat of spreading. For example, by enforcing lockdowns.\n- Mitigating or reducing its risk, severity or consequences. For example, researching and implementing vaccine trials in India.\n- Capacity-building and preparing to deal with Covid-19. For example, opening Covid-19 testing centres and camps across states.\n- Assessing the severity or magnitude of the effects of Covid-19. For example, taking surveys and tracking cases through applications such as Aarogya Setu.\n\nThe Government imposes periodicallockdownsby giving a set of directions to all Ministries/Departments of the Government of India, State/Union Territory Governments and State/Union Territory Authorities.2These lockdown orders are published on the Ministry of Home Affairswebsite.",

V.K.V. Sarma (2013) 15 SCC 755.)).\n\nCourts, through various cases(( Revanasiddappa v.

      "content": "Noise pollution is largely a by-product of industrialisation, urbanisation and modern civilisation. Noise pollution has two sources1i.e. industrial and non-industrial.\n\n- The industrial source includes the noise from various industries and big machines working at a very high speed and high noise intensity.\n- Non-industrial source of noise includes the noise created by transport/vehicular traffic and the neighbourhood noise generated by various noise pollutants can also be divided into categories, namely, natural and man-made.\n\nMost leading noise sources are:2\n\nNoise from the motors and exhaust systems of large trucks are common sources of noise pollution. For instance, the interaction of tyres with the roadway by trucks, buses, and private autos cause noise pollution. In cities, the main sources of traffic noise are the motors and exhaust systems of autos, smaller trucks, buses, and motorcycles. Read more on noise from vehicleshere.\n\nAircraft are a major source of noise pollution and the lawprescribes noise limitson airports depending on the aircraft movement and the area where the aircraft is situated, i.e., industrial area or commercial area.\n\nThe noise from locomotive engines, horns and whistles, and switching and shunting operations in rail yards are sources of noise pollution. For example, rail car retarders which is a device that reduces the speed of a freight unit or a railway coach, can produce a high-frequency that can reach peak levels of 120 dB at a distance of 100 feet.\n\nThe noise from the construction of highways, city streets, and buildings is a major contributor to the noise and air pollution in cities. For example, construction noise sources include:\n\n- Air Hammers\n- Air compressors\n- Bulldozers\n- Loaders and\n- Dump trucks\n\nFans, motors, and compressors mounted on the outside of industrial buildings may disturb people living near noisy manufacturing plants. Above all, noise from machines and industries have a significant impact on industrial workers, among whom noise-inducedhearing lossis unfortunately common.\n\nInternal building noise from plumbing, boilers, generators, air conditioners, and fans, can be audible and annoying. Improperly insulated walls and ceilings can reveal the sound of amplified music, voices, footfalls, and noisy activities from neighbours. External noise from emergency vehicles, traffic, refuse collection, and other city noises can be a problem for urban residents. Especially when the windows are open.\n\nCertain household equipment, for instance, vacuum cleaners and some kitchen appliances are common sources of noise noisemakers, although their contribution to the daily noise levels is usually not very large.\n\nIndian festivals like Diwali, marriages, etc. use fireworks during celebrations.\n\nHowever, bursting firecrackers is a health hazard since it is responsible for both air pollution and noise pollution. The noise created is hazardous, can lead sometimes to non-recoverable hearing loss.",

In several cases, courts have upheld the freedom of circulation as a crucial aspect of the freedom of expression.\n\nIn 1950, the Supreme Court ruled on a challenge to an order of the State of Madras banning the entry and circulation of an English Journal called \u201cCross Roads\u201d, on grounds of public safety and public order. This journal was printed and published in Bombay. The journal was banned under the Madras Maintenance of Public Order Act 1949. The court quashed the concerned provision of the Act and the associated government order, as they restricted free speech and expression.1\n\nAnother case challenged the Central government\u2019s Newsprint Policy of 1972-73 which compelled newspapers to compromise between circulation and content by creating price brackets for a higher number of pages. Here, the Supreme Court held that \u201cThe right to determine the number of pages has been held to be an aspect of the freedom of expression as it has a direct impact on the quantity and quality of content being published.\u201d2Though such restriction was imposed for economic reasons, it negatively impacted the freedom of the press, as they had to limit their coverage to obey the policy, which violated the right to circulation.",

      "content": "Force majeure1clauses are contractual clauses which can change or excuse the parties\u2019 obligations and/or liabilities under a contract when an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond their control prevents one or all of them from fulfilling those obligations. For example, if a construction company had to do work for a private company, they can use the force majeure clause in their contract from stopping the work in case of a disaster like an earthquake etc.\n\nDepending on how the contract is drafted, such clauses may have a variety of consequences, including:\n\n- Excusing the affected party from performing the contract partially or fully .\n- Excusing that party from delay in performance.\n- Allowing them to suspend or claim an extension of time for performance.\n- Giving that party a right to terminate the contract.\n\nForce majeure can include events for which no person can be held accountable. Some examples include Act of God or natural disasters, war or war-like situations, human actions such as armed conflict etc. For a force majeure clause to be invoked, the acts must be unforeseeable, external to the parties of the contract, and unavoidable. The law relating to Force Majeure is given under Sections 32 and 56 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.\n\nWhether a contractual obligation can be avoided on the grounds of force majeure is a factual determination based on the specific terms of the contract. The courts will examine,\u00a0 in each case, whether the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic prevented the party from performing its contractual obligation. Indian courts2have generally recognised this concept and have enforced it where appropriate.\n\nThe Government of India has taken the following measures to prevent further disruption in international trade and commerce by declaring the outbreak of Covid-19 as a force majeure event.\n\n- The Ministry of Finance issued an officememorandumdated February 19, 2020 which states that Force Majeure clauses can be invoked in Government contracts if there is a \u201cdisruption in supply chain due to spread of coronavirus in China or any other country\u201d.

Pre-censorship happens when the State imposes prior restraint to restrict the freedom of artistic expression through any form of art.

In 1970, the Supreme Court while deciding a challenge to the pre-censorship of a short film \u2018A Tale of Four Cities\u2019 refused to accept the distinction between pre-censorship and censorship in general and considered both to be within the scope of reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2). The Court found that pre-censorship is permitted under the Constitution for maintenance of public order and tranquillity.1\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court decides such cases based on their specific facts. For instance, in a 2018 judgement,2the Supreme Court ruled against prior restraint on the screening of the film Padmaavat since the requisite Censor Board permissions had been taken. Gujarat and Rajasthan governments had banned the screening on grounds of public order. The Court held that artistic expression is an inseparable part of freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a). After the Central Board of Film Certification has already certified a film as per its mandate and internal reviewing policies, individual governments cannot exercise prior restraint on the film.",

The Court reinstated the \u2018A\u2019 certificate and observed that the scenes with nudity were crucial to the overall narration of the story.

Article 21 of the Constitution of India, 1950 preserves the right to life all persons. This also extends to your right to access emergency medical care. All state governments have the duty to preserve the lives of patients seeking medical care.1.Further, all medical professionals and doctors in both private and government hospitals have a responsibility and duty towards the health of the community.2\n\nNo patient can be turned away from receiving emergency medical care if they cannot pay for it. Emergency care should be mandatorily provided and all standards of care and quality must be upheld while doing so. Doctors cannot put the life of a patient at stake while waiting for fees to be paid.3\n\nIt is their duty4to first render emergency medical care before receiving payment. Other duties of doctors in case of emergency care are:\n\n- No physician can arbitrarily refuse treatment to a patient. It can only be done if the physician is not qualified to treat the condition in which case the physician must refer the patient to another competent physician.5\n- While referral in the normal course is acceptable, in case of an emergency the physician should treat the patient\n- A physician is free to choose when and who he treats. However, in case of an emergency, he must respond when called upon.6\n- Physicians should not neglect or withdraw from the case without giving prior and adequate notice to the caregivers of the patient6\n\nEmergency medical care tochild victimsof sexual violence has been guaranteed under the law7.The same should be provided to them within 24 hours of receiving the\u00a0 complaint. A hospital, doctor or other medical facility providing such care cannot demand a legal order as a requirement for starting treatment.8.Maintaining the privacy of the child and the child\u2019s details is a duty of the doctor. Further, a parent or guardian who the child trusts has to be present for all the treatments.9\n\nIn case ofadult victimsof sexual offences, all hospitals, whether public or private, have to provide first-aid or medical treatment free of cost.\u00a0 Hospitals are also required to immediately inform the police of such incident.10Not following these rules will be punishable with jail time of up to one year and/or with a fine.11When medical practitioners are treating a sexual assault survivor, the presence of a woman during the treatment and with the consent of the patient or her guardian are essential.12\n\nIf there is a need to conduct an immediate abortion to save a pregnant woman\u2019s life, no matter how far along thepregnancyis (even if it is beyond the legally permitted period of 20 weeks), the doctor can conduct the abortion. Registered medical practitioner who do not have the required OB-GYN qualifications can perform abortions. Although this can only be done to save the life of the woman or the foetus. For example, if a woman who is 22 weeks pregnant was in a car crash, then a doctor can conduct an immediate abortion to save the woman\u2019s life. The doctor will not be punished as they have acted in good faith.\n\nAn accident victim can approach any hospital, public or private.13The doctor on duty has to immediately attend to the injured person and render medical aid without waiting for any procedural formalities.14Every government and private hospital is duty-bound to accept accident victims and patients who are in critical condition. The hospital\u00a0 cannot refuse treatment even if:\n\n- The victim is not in a position to pay the fee or meet the expenses or\n- There is no close relation of the victim available who can give consent for medical treatment.15\n\nThe Supreme Court and the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways have made it easier for people to help victims of road accidents. Earlier, people hesitated to stop and help such victims for fear of the cumbersome medico-legal process. Realizing the adverse impact this can have on survival chances of accident victims, the Supreme Court gave effect to the Good Samaritan Law.16.You can read more about ithere.\n\nIf you need to help an accident victim, you can contact theNational Highway Helpline at 1033.

Commonly, when someone seeks a mortgage from a bank, they bind themselves to pay the loan, without delivering the possession of the mortgaged property, and agree that if they fail to repay the amount, the bank has the right to claim the mortgaged property and use it to settle the loan. Such mortgaged properties claimed by the creditors are often sold off in auctions as\u00a0 \u2018foreclosed\u2019(( Foreclosure of property is dealt with under Section 67 of the TP Act and also the provisions of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Securities Interest Act, 2002)) or \u2018distressed\u2019 properties under the SARFAESI Act.",

You can even ask the Returning Officer to have the postal ballot delivered to you personally.\n\nIf for some reason your postal ballot gets damaged and you cannot cast your vote through it, you can ask your Returning Officer to send you a second set of ballot papers and return the spoiled ones back to him. Only if the Returning Officer is satisfied that they are indeed spoiled, he will send you a second set.\n\nTo reduce the time of sending ballot papers, the Election Commission has set up an ETPB method \u2013 Electronically Transmitted Postal Ballots. By using ETPB, the Returning Officer can send you the ballot papers electronically and you can download the same using an OTP (One Time Pin) generated specifically for you. Once you have entered your OTP, you can download your forms accordingly. For further information, please refer to the Election Commission\u2019sService Voter Portal.1\n\nOnce you have received your ballot papers, follow the steps mentioned below to cast your vote:\n\nIn order to cast your vote on the postal ballot you must either out a tick mark (\u2713) or cross mark (x) next to the name of the candidate you want to vote for. But you must not write or mark anything on the ballot paper that would reveal your identity.\n\nFill in Form 13A declaring that you have casted your postal ballot and get it attested by a notary/stipendiary magistrate or the commanding officer of your unit, ship or establishment (depending upon which wing of the armed forces you are from). If you are a government official serving abroad, you must get it attested by the diplomatic or consular representative of India at the country where you are posted.\n\nAfter marking your vote and getting your declaration attested, note down the serial number of your ballot paper on the Form 13B cover and place your marked ballot paper inside it and seal it.\n\nTake the sealed Form 13B and your Form 13A declaration and put it in an envelope (Form 13C) addressed to your Returning Officer and post it by the time and date mentioned accordingly. You do not need to affix any postal stamp on your envelope. If you send it after the fixed time, your vote will not be counted. If you are a government official casting your postal ballot then you can send it either by airmail or as a diplomatic package.",

These rules are broadly similar, and prescribe various requirements for shopkeepers selling acid:\n\nIf a shopkeeper does not follow these rules for the first time, the punishment is a jail term for up to 3 months, or with a fine of up to Rupees 500, or with both.(( Section 2 and 6, The Poisons Act, 1919; Section 15, the Chhattisgarh Regulation, Prohibition, Sale and use of Acid Act, 2013.)) For repeating the crime, the punishment is a jail term of up to 6 months, or with a fine of Rupees 1000, or with both. Hence, a criminal complaint or FIR can be filed against them for the illegal sale of acid. Such acid which is illegally stored will also be confiscated from the shopkeeper.(( Section 6(2), the Poisons Act, 1919.))\n\nThe Government of India has also framedModel Rules (the Poisons Possession and Sale Rules, 2013)for states and UTs to refer to while framing their respective rules. The Supreme Court has mandated states to make their rules as stringent as these Model rules.(( Laxmi v Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [7].))

Union of India and others, (2016) 3 SCC 571 [12], [13].))\n\nRules by the Supreme Court\n\nThe Supreme Court gave guidelines about the sale of acid, to be followed in states which did not have state rules for sale of acid.(( Laxmi v. Union of India and Others, (2014) 4 SCC 427 [9]-[11].)) Under these guidelines, the shopkeepers must follow the following regulations:\n\n- They can only undertake over-the-counter sale of acid, if they maintain a register with the details of the buyer, their address, and the quantity sold.\n- They must only sell acid after the buyer shows a government issued photo ID with the address of the person, and specifies their reason for buying the acid.\n- They must declare their stocks of acid within 15 days to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of the district.\n- They must not sell acid to minors.\n\nUnder these Court guidelines, a person can also complain to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate (SDM) of the district as they have a responsibility to ensure the guidelines are followed and can levy fines on shopkeepers breaching the rules given above.",

However, if there is a delay in complaining against the domestic violence that you have faced, you might be asked to explain the reasons behind the delay.\n\nGiven below are some specific situations where you may file a complaint against domestic violence:\n\nThough the law(( V.D.Bhanot v. Savita Bhanot (2012) 3 SCC 183.)) on domestic violence came into force in 2005, the law allows you to file an application for relief and/or protection even against any domestic violence that happened before 2005. If you are a woman who faced violencebefore 2005,\u00a0 you would still be entitled to protection under the law and you can approach the Court to file a case. For example, if a woman, Sita, faced domestic violence from her mother-in-law in 2001, she would still be eligible to go to Court to file a domestic violence case , even if the law on domestic violence came into force after she had already experienced domestic violence.\n\nYou can file a complaint against domestic violenceeven if you are already divorced(( Smt.Sabana @ Chand Bai & Anr vs Mohd.Talib Ali & Anr 2014 (2) RCR (Criminal) 293.)).For example, Seema got married in 2012 and for two years she faced physical violence from her husband. She divorced her husband in 2014. Seema has a right to file a domestic violence case after 2014 against her ex-husband for hurting her during the two years she was married to him.
