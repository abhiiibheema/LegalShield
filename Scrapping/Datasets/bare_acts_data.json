            "url": "https://lawrato.com/indian-kanoon/constitution-of-india/article-162",
            "description": "DescriptionSubject to the provisions of this Constitution, the executive power of a State shall extend to the matters with respect to which the Legislature of the State has power to make laws:Provided that in any matter with respect to which the Legislature of a State and Parliament have power to make laws, the executive power of the State shall be subject to, and limited by, the executive power expressly conferred by this Constitution or by any law made by Parliament upon the Union or authorities thereof.Article 162Article 162 of the Constitution lays down the extent of executive power of the State. Executive power is the authority to govern the State and to enforce orders.The 7th Schedule of the Constitution of India gives the allocation of powers and functions between the Union (Centre) and the States. It consists of three lists - Union List, State List and the Concurrent List. The Union Government/Parliament has the exclusive power to legislate on matters relating to items in the Union List. Similarly, the respective State Governments have exclusive power to legislate on matters/subjects given in the State List. Under the IIIrd List, i.e. the Concurrent List, both the Union and the State authorities have jurisdiction to legislate.According to this Article, the State's executive authority is exclusive for those matters that are mentioned in List II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India. This authority also extends to the IIIrd List i.e. the Concurrent List, except if the Constitution or any law that may have been passed by the Parliament say otherwise.This Article does not specify the definition of what executive power or function is, but is only concerned with the area of or distribution of the executive powers of the State. Article 162 states that the powers of the State executive extend to those matters upon which the State has the power or the authority to legislate/make laws, and are thereby not confined to those matters over which the States have already legislated upon. Similarly, Article 73 of the Constitution lays down the extent of executive power of the Union.If any law that has been enacted by the Parliament lays down that the Union authorities have the power or duty to execute a certain law on a subject in the Concurrent List, then, the State would not be left with the power to exercise executive functions in relation to that subject (up to the extent of powers exercisable by the Union authorities).Any decision in exercise of the executive power of the Government can be reviewed by the Court under Article 226 of the Constitution. The judiciary's powers are limited to examining whether the Government acted in a bona fide manner and on relevant considerations only.According to the wordings of Article 162, the extent of executive power of a State is coextensive with its legislative power. In the Concurrent List i.e. the IIIrd List, the executive power of the State would be subject to any laws conferring power to execute on the Union. Where the powers of executing a law on a subject mentioned in the Concurrent List are conferred upon the Union Authorities/Government, by any law enacted by the Parliament or by the Constitution, the executive powers of the State to that extent would stand abrogated."

The citizen's right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by article 19(1)(a) has been held by some courts to be so comprehensive as not to render a person culpable even if he advocates murder and other crimes of violence. In other countries with written constitutions, freedom of speech and of the press is not regarded as debarring the State from punishing or preventing abuse of this freedom. The citizen's right to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business conferred by article 19(1)(g) is subject to reasonable restrictions which the laws of the State may impose \"in the interests of general public\". While the words cited are comprehensive enough to cover any scheme of nationalisation which the State may undertake, it is desirable to place the matter beyond doubt by a clarificatory addition to article 19(6). Another article in regard to which unanticipated difficulties have arisen is article 31. The validity of agrarian reform measures passed by the State Legislatures in the last three years has, in spite of the provisions of clauses (4) and (6) of article 31, formed the subject-matter of dilatory litigation, as a result of which the implementation of theseimportant measures, affecting large numbers of people, has been held up.The main objects of this Bill are, accordingly to amend article 19 for the purposes indicated above and to insert provisions fully securing the constitutional validity of zamindari abolition laws in general and certain specified State Acts in particular. the opportunity has been taken to propose a few minor amendments to other articles in order to remove difficulties that may arise.It is laid down in article 46 as a directive principle of State policy that the State should promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. In order that any special provision that the State may make for the educational, economic or social advancement of any backward class of citizens may not be challenged on the groundof being discriminatory, it is proposed that article 15(3) should be suitably amplified. Certain amendments in respect of articles dealing with the convening and proroguing of the sessions of Parliament have been found necessary and are also incorporated in this Bill. So also a few minor amendments in respect of articles 341, 342, 372 and 376.New Delhi; JAWAHARLAL NEHRU. The 10th May, 1951.THE CONSTITUTION (FIRST AMENDMENT) ACT, 1951[18th June,1951.]An Act to amend the Constitution of India. BE it enacted by Parliament as follows:-1.

Although at present Sindhi is not a regional language in a well-defined area, it used to be the language of a province of the undivided India and, but for partition, would have continued to be so. The Commissioner for Linguistic Minorities has also recommended the inclusion of Sindhi in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. On 4th November, 1966, it was announced that Government had decided to include the Sindhi language in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution. The Bill seeks to give effect to this decision.NEW DELHI; Y. B.

The result of the judgment is that Parliament is considered to have no power to take away or curtail any of the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution even if it becomes necessary to do so for giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy and for the attainment of the objectives set out in the Preamble to the Constitution. It is, therefore, considered necessary to provide expressly that Parliament has power to amend any provision of the Constitution so as to include the provisions of Part III within the scope of the amending power.2. The Bill seeks to amend article 368 suitably for the purpose and makes it clear that article 368 provides for amendment of the Constitution as well as procedure therefor. The Bill further provides that when a Constitution Amendment Bill passed by both Houses of Parliament is presented to the President for his assent, he should give his assent thereto.

In the Bank Nationalization case [1970, 3 S.C.R. 530), the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution guarantees right to compensation, that is, the equivalent in money of the property compulsorily acquired. Thus in effect the adequacy of compensation and the relevancy of the principles laid down by the Legislature for determining the amount of compensation have virtuality become justiciable inasmuch as the Court can go into the question whether the amount paid to the owner of the property is what may be regarded reasonably as compensation for loss of property. In the same case, the Court has also held that a law which seeks to acquire or requisition property for a public purpose should also satisfy the requirements of article 19 (1) (f).2. The Bill seeks to surmount the difficulties placed in the way of giving effect to the Directive Principles of State Policy by the aforesaid interpretation. The word \"compensation\" is sought to be omitted from article 31(2) and replaced by the word \"amount\". It is being clarified that the said amount may be given otherwise than in cash. It is also proposed to provide that article 19(1)(f) shall not apply to any law relating to the acquisition or requisitioning of property for a public purpose.3. The Bill further seeks to introduce a new article 31C which provides that if any law is passed to give effect to the Directive Principles contained in clauses (b) and (c) of article 39 and contains a declaration to that effect, such law shall not be deemed to be void on the ground that it takes away or abridges any of the rights contained in article 14, 19 or 31 and shall not be questioned on the ground that it does not give effect to those principles. For this provision to apply in the case of laws made by State Legislatures, it is necessary that the relevant Bill should be reserved for the consideration of the President and receive his assent.NEW DELHI; H.

The Resolution declared that the Assembly had satisfied itself that these activities of the Chogyal not only violated the objectives of the Agreement of May 8, 1973, but also ran counter to the wishes of the people of Sikkim and impeded their democratic development and participation in the political and economic life of India. Accordingly the Assembly solemnly declared and resolved that \"The institution of the Chogyal is hereby abolished and Sikkim shall henceforth be a constituent unit of India, enjoying a democratic and fully responsible Government\"2. The Assembly also resolved that this Resolution be submitted to the people of Sikkim forthwith for their approval. A special opinion poll conducted by the Government of Sikkim on the 14th April, 1975 resulted in a total of 59,637 votes in favour and 1,496 votes against the Resolution out of a total electorate of approximately 97,000.3. The result of this poll was communicated to the Government of India by the Chief Minister of Sikkim on the 15th April, 1975. The Chief Minister on behalf of the Council of Ministers strongly requested the Government of India to make an immediate response and accept the above decision, taking, as has been requested in the Assembly Resolution of the 10th April, 1975, such measures as may be necessary and appropriate to implement the decision as early as possible.\\4. The Chief Minister and other Ministers of Sikkim also visited New Delhi on the 16th-17th April, 1975 and urged the Government of India to take immediate action in this behalf.5. Accordingly, it is proposed to include Sikkim as a full-fledged State in the First Schedule to the Constitution and to allot to Sikkim one seat in the Council of States and one seat in the House of the People.

            "description": "DescriptionTHE CONSTITUTION (FORTY-SECOND AMENDMENT) ACT, 1976Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-fourth Amendment) Bill, 1976 (Bill No. 91 of 1976) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-second Amendment) Act, 1976STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONSA Constitution to be living must be growing. If the impediments to the growth of the Constitution are not removed, the Constitution will suffer a virtual atrophy. The question of amending the Constitution for removing the difficulties which have arisen in achieving the objective of socio-economic revolution, which would end poverty and ignorance and disease and inequality of opportunity, has been engaging the active attention of Government and the public for some years now.2. The democratic institutions provided in the Constitution are basically sound and the path for progress does not lie in denigrating any of these institutions. However, there could be no denial that these institutions have been subjected to considerable stresses and strains and that vested interests have been trying to promote their selfish ends to the great detriment of public good.3. It is, therefore, proposed to amend the Constitution to spell out expressly the high ideals of socialism, secularism and the integrity of the nation, to make the directive principles more comprehensive and give them precedence over those fundamental rights which have been allowed to be relied upon to frustrate socio-economic reforms for implementing the directive principles. It is also proposed to specify the fundamental duties of the citizens and make special provisions for dealing with anti-national activities, whether by individuals or associations.4. Parliament and the State Legislatures embody the will of the people and the essence of democracy is that the will of the people should prevail. Even though article 368 of the Constitution is clear and categoric with regard to the all inclusive nature of the amending power, it is considered necessary to put the matter beyond doubt. It is proposed to strengthen the presumption in favour of the constitutionality of legislation enacted by Parliament and State Legislatures by providing for a requirements as to the minimum number of Judges for determining questions as to the constitutionality of laws and for a special majority of not less than two-thirds for declaring any law to be constitutionally invalid. It is also proposed to take away the jurisdiction of High Courts with regard to determination of Constitutional validity of Central laws and confer exclusive jurisdiction in this behalf on the Supreme Court so as to avoid multiplicity of proceedings with regard to validity of the same Central law in different High Courts and the consequent possibility of the Central law being valid in one State and invalid in another State.5. To reduce the mounting arrears in High Courts and to secure the speedy disposal of service matters, revenue matters and certain other matters of special importance in the context of the socio-economic development and progress, it is considered expedient to provide for administrative and other tribunals for dealing with such matters while preserving the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in regard to such matters under article 136 of the Constitution. It is also necessary to make certain modifications in the writ jurisdiction of the High Courts under article 226.6. It is proposed to avail of the present opportunity to make certain other amendments which have become necessary in the light of the working of the Constitution.7. The various amendments proposed in the Bill have been explained in the notes on clauses.8. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.NEW DELHI; H. R.

            "description": "DescriptionTHE CONSTITUTION (FORTY-FOURTH AMENDMENT)Statement of Objects and Reasons appended to the Constitution (Forty-fifth Amendment) Bill, 1978 (Bill No. 88 of 1978) which was enacted as THE CONSTITUTION (Forty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1978STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONSRecent experience has shown that the fundamental rights, including those of life and liberty, granted to citizens by the Constitution are capable of being taken away by a transient majority. It is, therefore, necessary to provide adequate safeguards against the recurrence of such a contingency in the future and to ensure to the people themselves an effective voice in determining the form of government under which they are to live. This is one of the primary objects of this Bill.2. It is, therefore, proposed to provide that certain changes in the Constitution which would have the effect of impairing its secular or democratic character, abridging or taking away fundamental rights prejudicing or impeding free and fair elections on the basis of adult suffrage and compromising the independence of judiciary, can be made only if they are approved by the people of India by a majority of votes at a referendum in which at least fifty-one per cent. of the electorate participate. Article 368 is being amended to ensure this.3. In view of the special position sought to be given to fundamental rights, the right to property, which has been the occasion for more than one amendment of the Constitution, would cease to be a fundamental right and become only a legal right. Necessary amendments for this purpose are being made to article 19 and article 31 is being deleted. It would, however, be ensured that the removal of property from the list of fundamental rights would not affect the right of minorities to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice.4. Similarly, the right of persons holding land for personal cultivation and within the ceiling limit to receive compensation at the market value would not be affected.5. Property, while ceasing to be a fundamental right, would, however, be given express recognition as a legal right, provision being made that no person shall be deprived of his property save in accordance with law.6. A Proclamation of Emergency under article 352 has virtually the effect of amending the Constitution by converting it for the duration into that of a Unitary State and enabling the rights of the citizen to move the courts for the enforcement of fundamental rights---including the right to life and liberty---to be suspended. Adequate safeguards are, therefore, necessary to ensure that this power is properly exercised and is not abused. It is, therefore, proposed that a Proclamation of Emergency can be issued only when the security of India or any part of its territory is threatened by war or external aggression or by armed rebellion. Internal disturbance not amounting to armed rebellion would not be a ground for the issue of a Proclamation.7. Further, in order to ensure that a Proclamation is issued only after due consideration, it is sought to be provided that an Emergency can be proclaimed only on the basis of written advice tendered to the President by the Cabinet. In addition, as a Proclamation of Emergency virtually has the effect of amending the Constitution, it is being provided that the Proclamation would have to be approved by the two Houses of Parliament by the same majority which is necessary to amend the Constitution and such approval would have to be given within a period of one month. Any such Proclamation would be in force only for a period of six months and can be continued only by further resolutions passed by the same majority. The Proclamation would also cease to be in operation if a resolution disapproving the continuance of the Proclamation is passed by Lok Sabha. Ten per cent. or more of the Members of Lok Sabha can requisition a special meeting for considering a resolution for disapproving the Proclamation.8. As a further check against the misuse of the Emergency provisions and to put the right to life and liberty on a secure footing, it would be provided that the power to suspend the right to move the court for the enforcement of a fundamental right cannot be exercised in respect of the fundamental right to life and liberty. The right to liberty is further strengthened by the provision that a law for preventive detention cannot authorise, in any case, detention for a longer period than two months, unless an Advisory Board has reported that there is sufficient cause for such detention. An additional safeguard would be provided by the requirement that the Chairman of an Advisory Board shall be a serving Judge of the appropriate High Court and that the Board shall be constituted in accordance with the recommendations of the Chief Justice of that High Court.9. A special provision is being made guaranteeing the right of the media to report freely and without censorship the proceedings in Parliament and the State Legislatures. The provision with regard to the breakdown of the constitutional machinery in the States is being amended so as to provide that a Proclamation issued under article 356 would be in force only for a period of six months in the first instance and that it cannot exceed one year ordinarily. However, if a Proclamation of Emergency is in operation and the Election Commission certifies that the extension of the President's rule beyond a period of one year is necessary on account of difficulties in holding elections to the Legislative Assembly of the State concerned, the period of operation of the Proclamation can be extended beyond one year. This is subject to the existing limit of three years. These changes would ensure that democratic rule is restored to a State after the minimum period which will be necessary for holding elections.10. With a view to avoiding delays, it is proposed to amend articles 132, 133 and 134 and insert a new article 134A to provide that a High Court should consider the question of granting a certificate for appeal to Supreme Court immediately after the delivery of the judgment, decree, final order or sentence concerned on the basis of an oral application by a party or, if the High Court deems fit so to do, on its own motion. Cases of special leave to appeal by Supreme Court will be left to be regulated exclusively by article 136.11. The other amendments proposed in the Bill are mainly for removing or correcting the distortions which came into the Constitution by reason of amendments enacted during the period of the Internal Emergency.12. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects. The notes on clauses explain in detail the various provisions of the Bill.NEW DELHI; SHANTI BHUSHAN.

If it is not combated, it is likely to undermine the very foundations of our democracy and the principles which sustain it. With this object, an assurance was given in the Address by the President to Parliament that the Government intended to introduce in the current session of Parliament an anti-defection Bill. This Bill is meant for outlawing defection and fulfilling the above assurance.2. The Bill seeks to amend the Constitution to provide that an elected member of Parliament or a State Legislature, who has been elected as a candidate set up by a political party and a nominated member of Parliament or a State Legislature who is a member of a political party at the time he takes his seat or who becomes a member of a political party within six months after he takes his seat would be disqualified on the ground of defection if he voluntarily relinquishes his membership of such political party or votes or abstains from voting in such House contrary to any direction of such party or is expelled from such party. An independent member of Parliament or a State Legislature shall also be disqualified if he joins any political party after his election. A nominated member of Parliament or a State Legislature who is not a member of a political party at the time of his nomination and who has not become a member of any political party before the expiry of six months from the date on which he takes his seat shall be disqualified if he joins any political party after the expiry of the said period of six months. The Bill also makes suitable provisions with respect to splits in, and mergers of, political parties. A special provision has been included in the Bill to enable a person who has been elected as the presiding officer of a House to sever his connections with his political party. The question as to whether a member of a House of Parliament or State Legislature has become subject to the proposed disqualification will be determined by the presiding officer of the House; where the question is with reference to the presiding officer himself, it will be decided by a member of the House elected by the House in that behalf.3.

It has been found that many of the countries have specified 18 years as the voting age. In our country some of the State Governments have adopted 18 years of age for elections to the local authorities. The present-day youth are literate and enlightened and the lowering of the voting age would provide to the unrepresented youth of the country an opportunity to give vent to their feelings and help them become a part of the political process. The present-day youth are very much politically conscious. It is, therefore, proposed to reduce the voting age from 21 years to 18 years.2.

Article 40 of the Constitution which enshrines one of the Directive Principles of State Policy lays down that the State shall take steps to organise village panchayats and endow them with such powers and authority as may be necessary to enable them to function as units of self-government. In the light of the experience in the last forty years and in view of the short-comings which have been observed, it is considered that there is an imperative need to enshrine in the Constitution certain basic and essential features of Panchayati Raj Institutions to impart certainty, continuity and strength to them.3. Accordingly, it is proposed to add a new Part relating to Panchayats in the Constitution to provide for among other things, Gram Sabha in a village or group of villages; constitution of Panchayats at village and other level or levels; direct elections to all seats in Panchayats at the village and intermediate level, if any, and to the offices of Chairpersons of Panchayats at such levels; reservation of seats for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for membership of Panchayats and office of Chairpersons in Panchayats at each level; reservation of not less than one-third of the seats for women; fixing tenure of 5 years for Panchayats and holding elections within a period of 6 months in the event of supersession of any Panchayat; disqualifications for membership of Panchayats; devolution by the State Legislature of powers and responsibilities upon the Panchayats with respect to the preparation of plans for economic developments and social justice and for the implementation of development schemes; sound finance of the Panchayats by securing authorisation from State Legislatures for grants-in-aid to the Panchayats from the Consolidated Fund of the State, as also assignment to, or appropriation by, the Panchayats of the revenues of designated taxes, duties, tolls and fees; setting up of a Finance Commission within one year of the proposed amendment and thereafter every 5 years to review the financial position of Panchayats; auditing of accounts of the Panchayats; powers of State Legislatures to make provisions with respect to elections to Panchayats under the superintendence, direction and control of the chief electoral officer of the State; application of the provisions of the said Part to Union territories; excluding certain States and areas from the application of the provisions of the said Part; continuance of existing laws and Panchayats until one year from the commencement of the proposed amendment and barring interference by courts in electoral matters relating to Panchayats.4.

As a result, Urban Local Bodies are not able to perform effectively as vibrant democratic units of self-government.2.

If a Municipality is dissolved before expiration of its duration, elections to be held within a period of six months of its dissolution;(g) devolution by the State Legislature of powers and responsibilities upon the Municipalities with respect to preparation of plans for economic development and social justice, and for the implementation of development schemes as may be required to enable them to function as institutions of self-government;(h) levy of taxes and duties by Municipalities, assigning of such taxes and duties to Municipalities by State Governments and for making grants-in-aid by the State to the Municipalities as may be provided in the State law;(i) a Finance Commission to review the finances of the Municipalities and to recommend principles for-(1) determining the taxes which may be assigned to the Municipalities;(2) Sharing of taxes between the State and Municipalities;(3) grants-in-aid to the Municipalities from the Consolidated Fund of the State;(j) audit of accounts of the Municipal Corporations by the Comptroller and Auditor-General of India and laying of reports before the Legislature of the State and the Municipal Corporation concerned;(k) making of law by a State Legislature with respect to elections to the Municipalities to be conducted under the superintendence, direction and control of the chief electoral officer of the State;(l) application of the provisions of the Bill to any Union territory or part thereof with such modifications as may be specified by the President;(m) exempting Scheduled areas referred to in clause (1), and tribal areas referred to in clause (2), of article 244, from the application of the provisions of the Bill.

We could not achieve this goal even after 50 years of adoption of this provision. The task of providing education to all children in this age group gained momentum after the National Policy of Education (NPE) was announced in 1986. The Government of India, in partnership with the State Governments, has made strenuous efforts to fulfil this mandate and, though significant improvements were seen in various educational indicators, the ultimate goal of providing universal and quality education still remains unfulfilled. In order to fulfil this goal, it is felt that an explicit provision should be made in the Part relating to Fundamental Rights of the Constitution.2. With a view to making right to free and compulsory education a fundamental right, the Constitution (Eighty-third Amendment) Bill, 1997 was introduced in Parliament to insert a new article, namely, article 21 A conferring on all children in the age group of 6 to 14 years the right to free and compulsory education. The said Bill was scrutinised by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Human Resource Development and the subject was also dealt with in its 165th Report by the Law Commission of India.3. After taking into consideration the report of the Law Commission of India and the recommendations of the Standing Committee of Parliament, the proposed amendments in Part III, Part IV and Part IVA of the Constitution are being made which are as follows:-(a) to provide for free and compulsory education to children in the age group of 6 to 14 years and for this purpose, a legislation would be introduced in Parliament after the Constitution (Ninety-third Amendment) Bill, 200l is enacted;(b) to provide in article 45 of the Constitution that the State shall endeavour to provide early childhood care and education to children below the age of six years; and(c) to amend article 5lA of the Constitution with a view to providing thatit shall be the obligation of the parents to provide opportunities for education to their children.3. The Bill seeks to achieve the above objects.MURLI MANOHAR JOSHI. NEWDELHI; The 16th November, 2001."

            "description": "DescriptionTHE CONSTITUTION (NINETY-FIRST AMENDMENT) ACT, 2003BE it enacted by Parliament in the Fifty-fourth Year of the Republic of India as follows:-1. This Act may be called the Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment) Act, 2003.2. In article 75 of the Constitution, after clause (1), the following clauses shall be inserted, namely:--\"(1A) The total number of Ministers, including the Prime Minister, in the Council of Ministers shall not exceed fifteen per cent. Of the total number of members of the House of the People.(1B) A member of either House of Parliament belonging to any political party who is disqualified for being a member of that House under paragraph 2 of the Tenth Schedule shall also be disqualified to be appointed as a Minister under clause (1) for duration of the period of commencing from the date of his disqualification till the date on which the term of his office as such member would expire or where he contests any election to either House of Parliament before the expiry of such period, till the date on which he is declared elected, whichever is earlier.\"3. In article 164 of the Constitution, after clause (1), the following clauses shall be inserted, namely:--\"(1A) The total number of Ministers, including the Chief Minister, in the Council of Ministers in a State shall not exceed fifteen per cent. of the total number of members of the Legislative Assembly of that State:Provided that the number of Ministers, including Chief Minister in a State shall not be less than twelve:Provided further that where the total number of Ministers including the Chief Minister in the Council of Ministers in any State at the commencement of the Constitution (Ninety-first Amendment) Act, 2003 exceeds the said fifteen per cent. or the number specified in the first proviso, as the case may be, then, the total number of Ministers in that State shall be brought in conformity with the provisions of this clause within six months from such date as the President may by public notification appoint.(1B) A member of Legislative Assembly of a State or either House of the Legislature of a State having Legislative Council belonging to any political party who is disqualified for being a member of that House under paragraph 2 of the Tenth Schedule shall also be disqualified to be appointed as a Minister under clause (1) for duration of the period commencing from the date of his disqualification till the date on which the term of his office as such member would expire or where he contests any election to the Legislative Assembly of a State or either House of the Legislature of a State having Legislative Council, as the case may be, before the expiry of such period, till the date on which he is declared elected, whichever is earlier.\"4. After article 361A of the Constitution, the following article shall be inserted, namely:--361B. A member of a House belonging to any political party who is disqualified for being a member of the House under paragraph 2 of the Tenth Schedule shall also be disqualified to hold any remunerative political post for duration of the period commencing from the date of his disqualification till the date on which the term of his office as such member would expire or till the date on which he contests an election to a House and is declared elected, whichever is earlier.Explanation.For the purposes of this article,--(a) the expression \"House\" has the meaning assigned to it in clause (a) of paragraph 1 of the Tenth Schedule;(b) the expression \"remunerative political post\" means any office:(i) under the Government of India or the Government of a State where the salary or remuneration for such office is paid out of the public revenue of the Government of India or the Government of the State, as the case may be; or(ii) under a body, whether incorporated or not, which is wholly or partially owned by the Government of India or the Government of a State and the salary or remuneration for such office is paid by such body, except where such salary or remuneration paid is compensatory in nature.5. In the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution,--(a) in paragraph 1, in clause (b), the words and figure \"paragraph 3 or, as the case may be,\" shall be omitted;(b) in paragraph 2, in sub-paragraph (1), for the words and figures \"paragraphs 3, 4 and 5\", the words and figures \"paragraphs 4 and 5\" shall be substituted;(c) paragraph 3 shall be omitted.STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONSDemands have been made from time to time in certain quarters for strengthening and amending the Anti-defection Law as contained in the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India, on the ground that these provisions have not been able to achieve the desired goal of checking defections. The Tenth Schedule has also been criticised on the ground that it allows bulk defections while declaring individual defections as illegal. The provisions for exemption from disqualification in case of splits as provided in paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India has, in particular, come under severe criticism on account of its destablilising effect on the Government.2. The Committee on Electoral Reforms (Dinesh Goswami Committee) in its report of May, 1990, the Law Commission of India in its 170th Report on \"Reform of Electoral Laws\" (1999) and the National Commission to Review the Working of the Constitution (NCRWC) in its report of March 31, 2002 have, inter alia, recommended omission of said paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India pertaining to exemption from disqualification in case of splits. The NCRWC is also of the view that a defector should be penalised for his action by debarring him from holding any public office as a Minister or any other remunerative political post for at least the duration of the remaining term of the existing Legislature or until, the next fresh elections whichever is earlier. It is proposed to accept these suggestions.3. The NCRWC has also observed that abnormally large Councils of Ministers were being constituted by various Governments at Centre and States and this practice had to be prohibited by law and that a ceiling on the number of Ministers in a State or the Union Government be fixed at the maximum of 10% of the total strength of the popular House of the Legislature.4. In the light of the above, it is proposed to amend the Constitution by omitting paragraph 3 of the Tenth Schedule to the Constitution of India and to provide that the size of the Council of Ministers should not be more than 10% of the strength of House or Houses concerned whether Unicameral or Bicameral. However, in case of smaller States like Sikkim, Mizoram and Goa having 32, 40 and 40 Members in the Legislative Assemblies respectively, a minimum strength of seven Ministers is proposed.5. The Bill seeks to achieve the objects mentioned above.ARUN JAITLEY. NEW DELHI; The 26th April, 2003."

K. VISWANATHAN, Secy. to the Govt. of India.STATEMENT OF OBJECTS AND REASONSGreater access to higher education including professional education to a� larger� number of students belonging to the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes has been a matter of major concern. At present, the number of seats available in aided or State maintained institutions, particularly in respect of professional education, is limited in comparison to those in private unaided institutions.2. It is laid down in article 46, as a directive principle of State policy, that the State shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and protect them from social injustice. To promote the educational advancement of the socially and educationally backward classes of citizens or of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in matters of admission of students belonging to these categories in unaided educational institutions, other than the minority educational institutions referred to in clause (1) of article 30 of the Constitution, it is proposed to amplify article 15.3.

A jurisdictional question if wrongly decided would not attract the principles of res judicata. When an Order is passed without jurisdiction, the same becomes a nullity. When an Order is a nullity, it cannot be supported by invoking procedural principle; Management of Sonepat Co-op. Sugar Mills Ltd. v. Ajit Singh, AIR 2005 SC 1050.(ii) There is a distinction between issue estoppel and res judicata. Res judicata debars a court from exercising its jurisdiction to determine the lis if it has attained finality whereas the doctrine of issue estoppel is invoked against the party. If such issue is decided against him, he would be estopped from raising the same in the latter proceedings. The doctrine of res judicata creats a different kind of estoppel viz. estoppel by Accord; Bhanu Kumar Jain v. Archana Kumar, AIR 2005 SC 626.(iii) First writ petition filed on the ground of apprehended bias and subsequent second petition was filed on allegations of actual bias, is not barred by res judicata; G.N. Nayak v. Goa University, AIR 2002 SC 790.(iv) Section 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure has no doubt some technical aspects for instance the rule of constructive res judicata may be said to be technical but the basis of which the said rule rests is founded on the consideration of public policy; Sumer Mal v. State of Rajasthan, AIR 2000 Raj 1.(v) The technical principle of res judicata would not be operative more so, if substantial change in circumstances is averred and found prima facie justified; Smt. Rehana Parveen v. Naimuddin, AIR 2000 MP 1.(vi) Assuming, the cause of action in both the suits was based upon title in the suit land and was akin in all the cases, yet, as referred to above, in as much the earlier two suits were dismissed as withdrawn with permission to file fresh on the same cause of action, third suit will not be barred by any principle of law; Harbhagwan v.

Punni Devi, AIR 1999 P&H 223.(vii) Where the Sangh has been duly represented in the previous court proceedings and were litigating bona fidely which resulted in failure cannot be allowed to lay any objection in execution or to plead nullity of decree hence doctrine of res judicata applies.

However, there are situations when an assembly may turn unruly causing damage to not only property but also to life rendering the assembly as Unlawful. In situations like these the administration has powers to issue orders prohibiting the people to assemble at one place or organise any such events where five or more people's gathering can be expected. This power has been rendered to the administration under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).What is Section 144 of CrPC?Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) of 1973 authorises the Executive Magistrate of any state or territory to issue an order to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area. According to the law, every member of such 'unlawful assembly' can be booked for engaging in rioting.Section 144 is imposed in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger of some event that has the potential to cause trouble or damage to human life or property. Section 144 of CrPC generally prohibits public gathering.Section 144 has been used in the past to impose restrictions as a means to prevent protests that can lead to unrest or riots. The orders to impose Section 144 have been conferred to Executive Magistrate when there is an emergency situation.What are the restrictions that can be imposed through an order under Section 144?The administration is empowered under Section 144 to impose restrictions on the personal liberties of individuals. This means the fundamental right of peaceful assembly provided under Article 19 of the Constitution is curtailed by the administration if the executive magistrate finds the situation at any specified place presenting a potential to disturbance in law and order.The restriction could be imposed in a specific locality or in the entire town. The defining aspect of imposing such a restriction is assessment of the situation by the district administration that it has the potential to cause unrest or danger to peace and tranquility in such an area due to certain disputes.Prevention of a crime or riot is the duty of the administration. Power conferred under Section 144 is absolute in terms of maintaining law and order.Once Section 144 of the CrPC is imposed in any area, all civilians are barred from carrying of weapons of any kind including lathis, sharp-edged metallic objects or firearms in public places. Police or other security personnel are the only ones allowed to carry weapons in areas placed under Section 144.What are the actions that can be taken against someone disobeying an order under Section 144?Whoever violates the prohibitory orders under Section 144 can be charged under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, i.e. Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant. If an order under Section 144 of the CrPC has been violated the police are authorized to exercise their powers under Section 188. However, the nature of the offence would decide the exercise of the provisions under the Act.Under Section 188 (1), the police has the power to arrest and detain anybody for some time, any person who violates such order. The punishment under the section after trial can go up to one month of simple imprisonment, if the person is convicted of violating the order.However, if a person arrested for violation of the order has a potential to threaten the law and order, or to endanger the lives of other people, the person arrested can be charged under Section 188 (2) of the Indian Penal Code. In such a case, the police has the power to detain the violator for a maximum of 24 hours before the violator has been let off on bail and can also be punished with up to six months of simple imprisonment if the person is convicted.The sections are both cognizable and bailable, that means, the violation under Section 144 would necessitate arrest and a person charged under the Section can be released on bail. Moreover, a fine up to Rs. 1,000 can also be imposed on the person charged with violation of Section 144.The police also have the powers to confiscate the vehicle of the violator. The period of confiscation of the vehicle can also be extended by the police if they deem fit. Furthermore, the police can also impound the driving license of the violator.What is the difference between restriction order under Section 144 and curfew?Restriction under Section 144 is different from curfew. In the areas where curfew is imposed, all public activity is barred. Civilian traffic is also stopped. Curfew warrants much graver situation posing bigger danger of rioting and violence.As a matter of rule, Section 144 is imposed for two months but it can be withdrawn any moment the administration finds the situation has attained normalcy. The government may extend the duration of restriction imposed under Section 144 beyond two months but not exceeding six months in one stretch.However, there are certain places which are highly sensitive have Section 144 imposed in the surrounding areas all the time. Parliament Building Complex and the Supreme Court of India are among such areas where Section 144 is always in force."

A by an instrument of gift professes to transfer it to B, giving by the same instrument Rs. 1,000 to C. C elects to retain the farm. He forfeits the gift of Rs. 1,000.In the same case, A dies before the election. His representative must out of the Rs. 1,000 pay Rs. 800 to B.The rule in the first paragraph of this section applies whether the transferor does or does not believe that which he professes to transfer to be his own.A person taking no benefit directly under a transaction, but deriving a benefit under it indirectly, need not elect.A person who in his own capacity takes a benefit under the transaction may in another dissent therefrom.Exception to the last preceding four rules. Where a particular benefit is expressed to be conferred on the owner of the property which the transferor professes to transfer, and such benefit is expressed to be in lieu of that property, if such owner claim the property, he must relinquish the particular benefit, but he is not bound to relinquish any other benefit conferred upon him by the same transaction.Acceptance of the benefit by the person on whom it is conferred constitutes an election by him to confirm the transfer, if he is aware of his duty to elect and of those circumstances which would influence the judgment of a reasonable man in making an election, or if he waives enquiry into the circumstances.Such knowledge or waiver shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be presumed, if the person on whom the benefit has been conferred has enjoyed it for two years without doing any act to express dissent.Such knowledge or waiver may be inferred from any act of his which renders it impossible to place the persons interested in the property professed to be transferred in the same condition as if such act had not been done.IllustrationA transfers to B an estate to which C is entitled, and as part of the same transaction gives C a coal-mine. C takes possession of the mine and exhausts it. He has thereby confirmed the transfer of the estate to B.If he does not within one year after the date of the transfer signify to the transferor or his representatives his intention to confirm or to dissent from the transfer, the transferor or his representatives may, upon the expiration of that period, require him to make his election ; and, if he does not comply with such requisition within a reasonable time after he has received it, he shall be deemed to have elected to confirm the transfer.In case of disability, the election shall be postponed until the disability ceases, or until the election is made by some competent authority.Apportionment.In the absence of a contract or local usage to the contrary, all rents, annuities, pensions, dividends and other periodical payments in the nature of income shall, upon the transfer of the interest of the person entitled to receive such payments, be deemed, as between the transferor and transferee, to accrue due from day to day, and to be apportionable accordingly, but to be payable on the days appointed for the payment thereof.Exception to the last preceding four rules"

However, there are situations when an assembly may turn unruly causing damage to not only property but also to life rendering the assembly as Unlawful. In situations like these the administration has powers to issue orders prohibiting the people to assemble at one place or organise any such events where five or more people's gathering can be expected. This power has been rendered to the administration under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC).What is Section 144 of CrPC?Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) of 1973 authorises the Executive Magistrate of any state or territory to issue an order to prohibit the assembly of four or more people in an area. According to the law, every member of such 'unlawful assembly' can be booked for engaging in rioting.Section 144 is imposed in urgent cases of nuisance or apprehended danger of some event that has the potential to cause trouble or damage to human life or property. Section 144 of CrPC generally prohibits public gathering.Section 144 has been used in the past to impose restrictions as a means to prevent protests that can lead to unrest or riots. The orders to impose Section 144 have been conferred to Executive Magistrate when there is an emergency situation.What are the restrictions that can be imposed through an order under Section 144?The administration is empowered under Section 144 to impose restrictions on the personal liberties of individuals. This means the fundamental right of peaceful assembly provided under Article 19 of the Constitution is curtailed by the administration if the executive magistrate finds the situation at any specified place presenting a potential to disturbance in law and order.The restriction could be imposed in a specific locality or in the entire town. The defining aspect of imposing such a restriction is assessment of the situation by the district administration that it has the potential to cause unrest or danger to peace and tranquility in such an area due to certain disputes.Prevention of a crime or riot is the duty of the administration. Power conferred under Section 144 is absolute in terms of maintaining law and order.Once Section 144 of the CrPC is imposed in any area, all civilians are barred from carrying of weapons of any kind including lathis, sharp-edged metallic objects or firearms in public places. Police or other security personnel are the only ones allowed to carry weapons in areas placed under Section 144.What are the actions that can be taken against someone disobeying an order under Section 144?Whoever violates the prohibitory orders under Section 144 can be charged under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, i.e. Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant. If an order under Section 144 of the CrPC has been violated the police are authorized to exercise their powers under Section 188. However, the nature of the offence would decide the exercise of the provisions under the Act.Under Section 188 (1), the police has the power to arrest and detain anybody for some time, any person who violates such order. The punishment under the section after trial can go up to one month of simple imprisonment, if the person is convicted of violating the order.However, if a person arrested for violation of the order has a potential to threaten the law and order, or to endanger the lives of other people, the person arrested can be charged under Section 188 (2) of the Indian Penal Code. In such a case, the police has the power to detain the violator for a maximum of 24 hours before the violator has been let off on bail and can also be punished with up to six months of simple imprisonment if the person is convicted.The sections are both cognizable and bailable, that means, the violation under Section 144 would necessitate arrest and a person charged under the Section can be released on bail. Moreover, a fine up to Rs. 1,000 can also be imposed on the person charged with violation of Section 144.The police also have the powers to confiscate the vehicle of the violator. The period of confiscation of the vehicle can also be extended by the police if they deem fit. Furthermore, the police can also impound the driving license of the violator.What is the difference between restriction order under Section 144 and curfew?Restriction under Section 144 is different from curfew. In the areas where curfew is imposed, all public activity is barred. Civilian traffic is also stopped. Curfew warrants much graver situation posing bigger danger of rioting and violence.As a matter of rule, Section 144 is imposed for two months but it can be withdrawn any moment the administration finds the situation has attained normalcy. The government may extend the duration of restriction imposed under Section 144 beyond two months but not exceeding six months in one stretch.However, there are certain places which are highly sensitive have Section 144 imposed in the surrounding areas all the time. Parliament Building Complex and the Supreme Court of India are among such areas where Section 144 is always in force."
